There’s a fair bit of discussion in the World-building: how science sculpts science fiction panel on whether scientific accuracy is important for science fiction. 
Discuss an element from the main novel you’re reading where something scientifically accurate or inaccurate affects how well the story works for you.

# Weeky Writing Assignment 5 - Importance of Scientific Accuracy in Science Fiction 
accuracy of time dilation

Becky chambers - Icy moon in 'to be taught, if fortunate' multicelluar organisms glow under ice at night (based on Europa possibly glowing in the dark)
mary - Kaguya, dense atmosphere (otherwise just float away), low gravity
john scalzi - "can make the world more interesting" discussing structuring exoplanets in "interdependency" around the current data on exoplanets not being habitable for humans (the more constraints that science gives you, the more you can speculate about interesting stuff, e.g speed of light is constant) 
if rooted in sound science, and then add additional fiction/speculation "people are more willing to make the leap", "set the rules, and followed the rules", "being honest with them (the reader)"
"more inclined to build the world with you"

moderator - "nature can trump our imagination" discusing planets orbiting pulsa; "can inspire you to think around the problem, so I don't want to call it a limitation"

endor man - "practical constraints not at the front of your mind" - discussing how medium affects accuracy, e.g. 2 suns on tatoonie interesting effect, physics questionable

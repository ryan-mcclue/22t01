There’s a fair bit of discussion in the World-building: how science sculpts science fiction panel 
on whether scientific accuracy is important for science fiction. 
Discuss an element from the main novel you’re reading where something 
scientifically accurate or inaccurate affects how well the story works for you.

# Weeky Writing Assignment 5 - Importance of Scientific Accuracy in Science Fiction 
In *The Forever War*, Einstein's theory of special relativity is applied with respect to time dilation. 
The fact that this is a scientifically accurate phenomenon, makes me more connected with the story.
It stirs my imagination into thinking that this could possibly happen to me or to future generations.
I'm able to vicariously experience the character's emotions of isolation and helplessness, leading to a far more impactful relationship with the story. 
I agree with the sentiments expressed by John Scalzi in *World-building: how science sculpts science fiction* that if the story is rooted in sound science "people are inclined to build the world with you".
Furthermore, because the story bows to the constraints of relativity it becomes more interesting as it has to invent ways to overcome them.
An example of this are the collapsars which act as pseudo wormholes that allow the characters to traverse huge distances in short periods of time without violating the constancy of the speed of light.
As described by Phil Plait, "[science] can inspire you to think around the problem" and "nature can trump our imagination".
However, despite being based on scientific fact, the mathematics of the time dilation used is not accurate.
At the initial part of the novel, the ship travels 0.9c and it's said that 2 years for those on board is 25 years for those on Earth.  
Using the time dilation formula in the lectures, this speed would only give approximately 4.6 years. The actual speed would have to be 0.9968c.
In spite of this, the fact that the story is based on accurate science, I'm willing to overlook this error as after all it's science fiction.
This is remarked upon by John Scalzi "people are more willing to make the leap"
Yet, although scientifically grounded, the most important part of *The Forever War* that leads me to enjoying it is the quality of the story.
It touches on ... which are themes that resonate with me. The quality of the story is the foundation and the science is ...
This is agreed upon by all members of *World-building: how science sculpts science fiction* 


Becky chambers - Icy moon in 'to be taught, if fortunate' multicelluar organisms glow under ice at night (based on Europa possibly glowing in the dark)
mary - Kaguya, dense atmosphere (otherwise just float away), low gravity
john scalzi - "can make the world more interesting" discussing structuring exoplanets in "interdependency" around the current data on exoplanets not being habitable for humans 
(the more constraints that science gives you, the more you can speculate about interesting stuff, e.g speed of light is constant) 
if rooted in sound science, and then add additional fiction/speculation "people are more willing to make the leap", "set the rules, and followed the rules", "being honest with them (the reader)"
"more inclined to build the world with you"

moderator (Phil Plait) - "nature can trump our imagination" discusing planets orbiting pulsa; "can inspire you to think around the problem, so I don't want to call it a limitation"

endor man - "practical constraints not at the front of your mind" - discussing how medium affects accuracy, e.g. 2 suns on tatoonie interesting effect, physics questionable

The fact that the house in Mother of Invention is watching Anjuli is a good thing – 
it’s the only other character in the story who is really paying attention to what she needs.

# Week 9 Writing Assignment - Difference Between Helpful AI and Surveillance Technology

The fundamental difference between a helpful AI like Obi 3 in *Mother of Invention* and surveillance technology is their ability to reason.
Surveillance technology is solely concerned with information gathering. Any analysis of this data is performed by human operators.
AI can be thought of a superset of surveillance technology in that it obtains data via surveillance technology.
The distinguishing feature of AI is its ability to analyse data and to then automatically make decisions that work towards acheiving a preprogrammed goal.

Surveillance technologies are implemented in a number of everyday interactions, e.g. mobile phones, world-wide-web usage, CCTV systems etc.
As they are only concerned with reconnaissance, different human organisations are responsible for analysing their data and making decisions from them.
In mobile phones, the location of the phone can be monitored by GPS or cell tower signal triangulation.

On the world-wide-web, the web browser uses your IP address to identify you and records your interactions on websites

Finally, CCTV systems record live footage of public areas and hold on to this data for long periods of time.

phone - GPS (policing, location tracking) 
internet - IP address and website interaction metrics (advertisement, anti-terrorism) 
CCTV - video recordings transmitted via ... (security)


In fact, can even generate it's own sub-goals...

"gnashed her teeth, clutching the metal planks" "Braxton Hicks pain in her lower belly"
"The moment she and Festus made eye contact, he began walking faster."

maintain stasis: "was always repairing and sometimes building on itself"
"it was always requesting something"
"The house had drawn itself into its most compact and secure shape" - response to storm

reassurance: "Relax, oh, relax, Anwuli. Breathe,"
care: "Are you sure you don’t want me to buy a ticket for you to Abuja?"
“Better?” Obi 3 asked

alleviation of physical work via drones: "drones zipped into the bedroom with a set of freshly washed and folded clothes"
"One of Obi 3’s drones pushed itself beside her to keep her from tumbling to the floor"
"carry her squirming daughter was not a human being but a drone"
"carrying a glass of water and her bottle of antihistamine tablets"
"drone put her in a tub of water to wash her off"

automation of tasks: “You have a phone call. Bayo.”

"The house glowed a soft lavender color that turned the ceiling a deeper sky blue"

"The house was her respect" refusing to leave despite serious allergic reaction (anaphalyxis) to periwinkle supergrass during a pollen tsunami 

Detection (surveillance is uninformed subset) "variations in electromagnetic noise my sensory lights pick up alert me"

forethought of future contingencies: "I built a duct to filter pollen from the air." 

some sort of goal "time for phase 2". which can then generate its own sub-goals

make deductions based on input "I did my own research and then engineered my plans"
"I invented a way, then I built my invention"
"Project Protective Egg."

1. Disruption of nature:

2. man's hubris:

3. emotional isolation:


opening credits black-and-white devoid of life. despondent, whirring noise indicating that there is life but no emotion
retirement not execution to dehumanise replicants
opening panning shot of dark, polluted sky covered with industrial buildings. no greenery, all artificial light
tyrell corporation building is like a pyramid, towering above all others, elevating to a god-like status 
tyrell interviewer is dismissive of subjects emotions like mentioning he is nervous or distressed. in fact seems to relish making him uncomfortable
similarly, deckard telling rachel she is a replicant is at first very awkward and uncomforting relaying information that is emotionally sensitive; almost as if the caring nature in humans is not typical
tannoy system 'start a again on the off-world colony'; resignation that current climate is terrible
even the police station is dirty, unkempt. only tyrell is clean
creation of origami is attempt to recreate life
4-year life span is failsafe; disregard their ability to develop emotion; refer to as 'skinjobs', 'it', 'them'. rachel is just an experiment to control them better etc.
asking 'do you like our owl?', immediate response is 'is it artificial?; of course' the idea of something natural is unheard of. genetically engineer eyes
tyrells office the only place that gets the sun, voices echo to make you feel insignificant. his glasses flicker with light

1. Disruption of nature:

2. man's hubris:

3. emotional isolation:

initial opening 'look to the stars for the promise of progress', implying lack of connection with the current world (things have stagnated) and desire to start fresh rather than reflect and repair.

opening monologue is very telling of disconnect: 'I'm focused on the essential to the exclusion of all else'; to be instrument of progress you must disregard all else 'space makes sense'
head cast down shutting of an emotional connection. he is giving a psychological assessment that is evaluated by a machine
'I see myself from the outside'; 'it's all a performance'; 'just don't touch me' to maintain his anemic state he must refrain from all emotional responses
falling from the ISS, maintains an unnatural level of calm; 
cannot maintain relationships, 'she said I had a self-destructive side'; 'i should feel something'
they value his pulse not going above 80, rather than care for his well-being or what that really represents (i.e. he has no emotional response and his most likely depressed)
when asked how he handled his father's absence he only mentions how it affected his mother; he can only describe emotions by relating how they are experienced in others
when discussing Lima project, surrounding officials only concerned with recording information rather than offering guidance/support; 
you must live by a collective rule and deal with your humanity on your own; 'are you with us?'
when talking about his father's disapperance and childhood absence 'that was that'
colonel talking to roy 'voyage of exploration can be used as an escape'; no realisation of what the implications mean for Roy in that his father did not want to see him again. his father promised to come back and take Roy with him
frequent close-ups to Roy's eyes; this is how he experiences emotion; no physical response
such isolation means Roy cannot maintain outside relationships and is Roy very self-critical 'i have made many mistakes in life'; unable/struggles to leave voice message for Eve
before mars mission; ever constant psyhcological evaluation to ensure higher-ups always have control
'the moon. where the world comes together' despite disputed territories in a state of war; trying to create a false sense of reality to reaffirm the supposed positives of what they are doing
concerning the colonel 'why can't he let go?'; roy asks himself theses questions as it's not in his nature to discuss emotional questions with another person in the open
colonel injured 'colonel you have an irregular heartbeat; i suggest you get that checked out'; no asking how he is. it's all about information processing; no emotion
mood stabliser pills.
ever repeating Roy voice-over to emphasis his lonliness/isolation.
onboard to mars the contrast between Roy and and the other crew members laughing and getting along.
many people discussing Roy's father are full of adulation and praise; this furthers Roy's image of himself as second-rate in the eyes of his father.
normal chain of command Roy is constantly in a submissive state being told what to do; even on trip to Mars his lower-ranked Captain does not adhere to his requests to ignore Mayday

1. Disruption of nature:

2. man's hubris:

3. emotional isolation:

initial opening 'look to the stars for the promise of progress', implying lack of connection with the current world (things have stagnated) and desire to start fresh rather than reflect and repair.

opening monologue is very telling of disconnect: 'I'm focused on the essential to the exclusion of all else'; to be instrument of progress you must disregard all else 'space makes sense'
head cast down shutting of an emotional connection. he is giving a psychological assessment that is evaluated by a machine
'I see myself from the outside'; 'just don't touch me' to maintain his anemic state he must refrain from all emotional responses
falling from the ISS, maintains an unnatural level of calm; 
cannot maintain relationships, 'she said I had a self-destructive side'; 'i should feel something'
they value his pulse not going above 80, rather than care for his well-being or what that really represents (i.e. he has no emotional response and his most likely depressed)
when asked how he handled his father's absence he only mentions how it affected his mother; he can only describe emotions by relating how they are experienced in others
when discussing Lima project, surrounding officials only concerned with recording information rather than offering guidance/support; 
you must live by a collective rule and deal with your humanity on your own; 'are you with us?'
when talking about his father's disapperance 'that was that'
colonel talking to roy 'voyage of exploration can be used as an escape'
frequent close-ups to Roy's eyes; this is how he experiences emotion; no physical response
such isolation meanas Roy cannot maintain outside relationships and is Roy very self-critical 'i have made many mistakes in life' 
ever constant psyhcological evaluation to ensure higher-ups always have control

Discusses both societal factors and scientific understanding

question/topic - overly broad, unclear
resources - minimal resources identified
form - not clearly described

1.
resources:
To introduce more resources that involve 'AI and technology in future',
dystopian Blade Runner movie (replicants ) and utopian Star Trek movie (help assist missions and make humans realise their own humanity)

question/topic:
An essay presents an argument and provides reasoning to back this up.
Your thesis does not outline an argument that you are intending to persuade the reader into thinking.
It's very open-ended.  Your project is in the form of a discussion rather than an essay.
It's important to keep this distinction in mind when you write, as you don't want to bias a particular point of view.

An interesting point of discussion may be to explore how the motivations for technological advances influence their outcomes.
e.g. does developing cybernetics for military purposes result in better/worse outcomes than if developed for better quality of life?

2.
question/topic:
Remember to make the distinction between each text's context/motivation for moving outer space.
This is important, as it affects the resources put into the mission and the psychology of those living aboard.
Therefore, whether the outcome of any is negative, it's worth mentioning that if the same mission with different resources was taken, the outcome might have been different. 

Outline the specific traits of what you think constitutes "humans of today" and relate to to these specifics
instead of such a general term, e.g. humans physical state, social structures etc.

As you mention your engineering background, make sure to also discuss societal factors as well as factors relating to the physical environments.

3.
question/topic:
War itself is not directly related to the course. Its effect on society could be considered a non-scientific discussion.
Make sure to mention scientific/technological developments made as a result of war and their negative consquences.

form:
You have a paragraph dedicated to the benefits of war but none to the negatives of war which is what you are arguing. 
Consider putting at least an equal amount of writing arguing in favour of your thesis.

No personalisation...

resources:
'war between humans and aliens'

Discusses both societal factors and scientific understanding

question/topic - overly broad, unclear
resources - minimal resources identified
form - not clearly described

1.
question/topic:
An essay presents an argument and provides reasoning to back this up.
Your thesis does not outline an argument that you are intending to persuade the reader into thinking.
It's very open-ended.  Your project is in the form of a discussion rather than an essay.
It's important to keep this distinction in mind when you write, as you don't want to bias a particular point of view.

2.
question/topic:
You mention two possibly ways of expressing your point of view.
"Can humanity as we know it thrive in space" is open-ended, offering different points of discussion as to what constitutes *thriving in space*
Later you outline a specific criteria "humanity **as we know it** would not able to sufficiently exist in space" 
This limits points of discussion which may or may not be beneficial to you. Something to consider.

As you mention your engineering background, make sure to also discuss societal factors as well as factors relating to the physical environments.

3.
question/topic:
War itself is not directly related to the course. Its effect on society could be considered a non-scientific discussion.
Make sure to mention scientific/technological developments made as a result of war and their negative consquences.

form:
You have a paragraph dedicated to the benefits of war but none to the negatives of war which is what you are arguing. 
There is an imbalance here.

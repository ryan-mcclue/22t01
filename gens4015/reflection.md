Refers to specific points in the peer reviews or tutor comments

TUTOR

"?" around 'extreme time dilation', explain what scientific technology allowed to travel this fast

PEERS

this was specifically mentioned in mind conditioning of Forever War: "what is the scientific advancement that has allowed this to be possible?"

in regards to Blade Runner disruption of nature 

(specifically outline what it currently means to be human and how science as impacted this)


# GENS4015 Reflection
It was suggested that I make the link between what topics I disscuss in my texts and how they relate to my thesis clearer.
Tutor: "Be careful you don't end up doing just a critique on the text itself but that you keep it relevant to your topic"
Peer: "It's important not to forget what you are trying to prove with your thesis" 
In line with this, I provide my definition of what I believe it currently means to be human.
This is ....
I will refer back to this definition in my paragraphs to stay on topic.

It was also noted that I need to specifically mention the particular scientific/technological advancements that have allowed the topics I discuss to be possible.
Tutor: "Make sure to include scientific and technological discussion rather than just talking about societal effects!"
Peer: "Mindful of not skipping over the scientific advancements discussion"
The peer comment "Are scientific advancements the root cause of this?" follows this train of thought.
Specifically, I need to state how a particular scientific/technological advancement has caused the topic I'm discussing.
To pinpoint the particular advancement used, I had to investigate the current state of knowledge in the fields of psychology, human reproduction ...
I have updated relevent sections of my project outline to mention these advancements:

## The Forever War:
1. Disruption of Nature:
  * PSYCHOLOGY 
    Extreme pychological manipulation and mind conditioning to alter natural thought processes.
    Soldiers have  their sense of empathy overridden in order to evoke intense hatred for the Taurans in battle.
    General population is controlled towards homosexuality in order to control birth rates. Heterosexuality viewed as sociopathic.
  * BIOLOGY
    No natural births. No concept of a parent. Adolescent years spent in an institution.
    Eugenics council controls all production of life, ensuring everyone has similar traits. 
    Eventually everyone is a clone.
  * AI AND COMPUTING HARDWARE
    All interactions dominated by computers and machinery (at their mercy)
    Spaceships and major weapons are almost exclusively controlled by a computer. 
    Physical acts like running and walking overriden by enhanced space suit.
    Education controlled with automated learning systems.
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * ENGINEERING
    Extreme time dilation makes it impossible to maintain social bonds outside of the Army.
    Army deliberately moves squad members around to prevent developing relationships.
    Forced to to 'sack' (have sex) with members of your squad every night.
    Emotions are reduced to physical releases that you don't become attuned with.
  * Desensitisation to death and suffering.
    The idea of a private dying in training or later on a mission is commonplace and underwhelming.
    On Earth, medical priority levels so only certain individuals get treatment.
    Individualism is discarded. Only duty and results matter.
## Ad Astra:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop interstellar travel and knowledge of life in the universe 
1. Man's Hubris:
  * SPACE TRAVEL
    Media censorship and propaganda rife in Space Force and on Earth. 
    The few in command believe they know what's best for everyone to acheive a better society.
    Roy is told lies about his father so that he is still motivated to continue work
  * Clifford's vanity meant he was in strong alignment with Space Force's message and so was selected as leader for the Lima project.
    He was the figurehead of Space Force excellence, promoting others to adopt his excessive self assurance in order to succeed 
    Even mild-mannered Roy adopts this mindset, as he illegally boards the ship to Neptune, thinking only he can get the job done
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Roy's complete lack of emotional responses is valued by Space Force, e.g. his pulse never going above 80 is commended.
    Roy's frequent voice-overs, closeup shots and relationship flashbacks further emphasis his emotional anaemia
    Room interiors are all muted colours. Soundtrack is monotonous and steady.
  * PSYCHOLOGY
    Psychological assessments are performed by a machine asking questions and subject speaking into an microphone.
    A repeated phrase to ensure passing is "I'm focused on the essential to the exclusion of all else" 
    On failure, you enter a solitary 'comfort room'. No human contact or emotional discussions. 
## Blade Runner:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop synthetic intelligent life
1. Disruption of Nature:
  * AI, BIOENGINEERING
    Shots of environment show excessive pollution, towering machinery, dirty streets, dark mottled skies and no trees or greenery.
    No natural light. All animals are artifical, epitomised with the existence of the Replicants.
    Soundtrack uses digital synthesisers, no physical instruments.
    Engineers now manufacturer body parts instead of doctors treating individuals.
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Deckard is portrayed as a loner. No scenes of him in a social setting, all work.
    Deckard's work colleagues show no concern for his wellbeing.
    Deckard himself is awkward and uncomforting relaying emotional information.
    When Deckard is subject to an event of high emotional impact, he undergoes physical shakes instead of healthy emotional expressions. 
  * Disregarding their ability to develop emotion, builtin to the Replicants is a '4 year fail-safe' that will shut them down after 4 years.
    Non-complying Replicants are sought for termination, not execution. This choice of words, along with slurs like 'skinjob' serves to dehumanise them.
    The Replicants exhibit varied emotions such as compassion, fear, anger and a desire to live.
    The Replicants emotions serve as a dichotomy to humanity's lack thereof.

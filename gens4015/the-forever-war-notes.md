Youthful cyninism/ignorance (questioning what is the point)
Collapsar is worm hole. High IQ individuals protect planets around collapsars, i.e. portal planets
Although no understanding, the development of interstellar travel has made more fearful of prospective threats, e.g. taurans with a returned drone attack 
Although the seeming wonders of space travel, to deal with the difficulties of space travel and dangers on other planets, resort to harmful substances, e.g. weed and cigaretes rampant.
Also, although capable, it will always be extremely dangerous to do this; travel and then suit-wearing on the planet, etc.
also loss of enjoyments, care-free living.
Quick to pass judgement on Taurans knowing what they are capable of
Lack of empathy/desensitised with knowledge of such destruction and frequent death (the idea of dying in training is just commonplace). 
First instinct to kill animals, capital punishment (no patience), destroy buildings (even inanimate objects are subject to this ideology)
Also human enhancements like enhanced weight bearing suits, automatic guns further the disconnect with our natural self.
Immense reliance on technology far too complicated for one person to understand (ships are landed via computer)
Immense investment and distances traversed, people easily become expendable commodites
prolonged time away from the norm can cause the loss of your humanity (they start caring, helping the man with the suit but later lose this as demonstrated by the more seasoned veterans)
Furthermore, the 'military law' to have sex with different people every night loses the emotional bonds of being human, and such 'human' sensations are seen as necessities and just physical releases
The high-risk endeavours of space travel involves high pressure situations where the slightest error can cause death. Serious affect on mental health
Extreme pychological manipulation to evoke hatred for the Taurans and to overcome our humanity to achieve particular tasks (good things get better, bad things get worse)
Lack of doing things for enjoyment, e.g. 'soyashit' a high concentrated foodstuff

Harmful effects of 'over-zealous hate conditioning'.
Uneasiness with being at the mercy of a computer
Feeling of detachment (remarking on the inability to send messages faster than the speed of light). generational loss of knowledge

Compare and contrast the difficulties in communication between humans and aliens:

In 'Tear Tracks', the difficulty in communicating between humans and aliens is largely due to cultural differences.
Through patience, open-mindedness and empathy, the text suggests that these difficulties can be overcome.
By embracing these differences, 'Tear Tracks' proposes that one can learn about the experience of suffering. 

From the beginning, Flur is uneasy with the emotional expressions of the Cyclopes "Flur finds each eye startlingly (perhaps deceptively?) expressive."
She expresses apprehension when inspecting the portraits of notable Cyclopes and struggles to coalesce what she is seeing with similar humans on Earth
"There are no confident smiles ... They look almost sorrowful ...  They look too sorrowful, the way the politicians at home look too distinguished"
These thoughts in Flur's mind are then realised in physical communication when Irnv introduces the President by casually reciting her misfortunes
"It’s the president ... She lost her three children and husband to sudden illness over the period of a year!"

"Flur has no idea how to respond to that"
"Flur wonders if they hear her spiel at all"

This feeling of causes distraction and makes Flur doubtful if her attempts at communicating are being interpreted as she is intending.

# Tear Tracks
* why do they arise? 
- primarily cultural differences 
* can they be overcome? 
- time, patience, humble
* what can we learn from each other?
- constituents of good character

Takes time to adjust. Inroads have to be made before personal relationships can develop and 'truth' obtained. this could all be for ceremony
Cultural differences: prodimantly female leadership (however this could be a false assumption made on personal experience), appearance purple skin, 
Differences in communication, e.g. "Flur finds each eye startlingly (perhaps deceptively?) expressive." preconcieved notions
Physical communication "Maybe that’s their idea of personal space?"
"they would find the sight of them in their tubed breathing apparatuses disconcerting"
" pressed against each other, fluttering suggestively"
perceived similarities can lead you down the wrong way of thinking
"There are no confident smiles; They look almost sorrowful" thinking that something is wrong
President wiping tears away from eyes?
Eating is social taboo; must be done by oneself
"wondering if she is right about the translation for ‘socialize.’"
Communicate through verbal; possible to learn and mimic beforehand (however could suffer from not being able to react to 'in-the-moment')
the aliens (Cyclops) view greif/pain as signs of wisdom. on earth, we try to cover up those things. they ultimately believe that good comes from bad. being able to show your sadness is a sign of character
fundamental unknown; just based on assumptions (Inrv named after Earth, yet 32 years old; learn to be humble and open-minded)


Comparatively in 'Deal', the difficulty in communicating between humans and aliens is largely due to differences in language.
Through hardwork, analysis and inquisitiveness, the text suggests that these difficulties can be overcome.
By embracing these differences, 'Deal' proposes that one can learn about the experience of perserverance.


# Deal
* why do they arise? 
- differences in language
* can they be overcome?
- through analysis and open-mindness, inquisitiveness
* what can we learn from each other?
- kindness (helping the environment; they are peaceful;), patience and sticking to task (Beluah and Kim in time can see oncologist) 

Does not take humanoid form. Purpose is unknown, ability to travel is unknown, leading to suspicion. (Kim scared to come out, yet is comfortable with a scorpion; the fear of uknown can be overwhelming for some)
Verbal communication is incredibly unnatural and difficult
The Visitors have encircled the Earth like a Lattice. This has had positive benefits like reducing UV and lowering temperatures to pre-industrial
Hinting at learning how to communicate with aliens can teach us to better understand ourselves "If Beulah can learn to talk to literal space aliens, maybe she can figure out why her girlfriend would rather get cancer than go to the doctor."
Feel scared/anxious at not knowing their intentions; can lead to thinking the worst "A cold finger draws itself down the length of her spine"

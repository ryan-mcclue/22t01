Sanctuary takes place in orbit around and on a planet named Tau Ceti-e. 
Is there really an exoplanet named Tau Ceti-e? 
Would you expect it to be habitable based on the description in the story? 
Why or why not?

Tau Ceti-e is a real exoplanet that orbits the star Tau Ceti in the Cetus constellation.
Considering Tau Ceti-e's distance from Tau Ceti, its mass and the mass of the Tau Ceti, it lies outside the 'habitable zone'. 
However, as discussed in week 3 lectures, the 'habitable zone' is a myopic determination of what is actually habitable.
Specifically, something can be considered habitable under specific circumstances.
Outlines information relating to 
Based on 'Sanctuary's' description, I believe Tau Ceti-e to be habitable for a small-scale, non-financially motivated colony.
However, given the extended fictional description of Tau Ceti-e's environment in 'Sanctuary', I believe Tau Ceti-e to be habitable under particular circumstances.

atmosphere sufficient levels of oxygen
higher surface gravity (coupled with prolonged period in microgravity)
lower atmospheric pressure (cloudiness, wet weather, less sun; more gasses can escape to atmosphere). thin but breathable, no strenous
temperature similar, yet no real middleground (fine for living though)
plant life containing suitable left-handed amino acids

evidence of life, however not detected by probes due to low level fossil fuel emission (not above threshold); so human activity may not work well
"spectrographic evidence of large-scale use of fossil fuels"
financial cost to maintain equipment, e.g. radiation and hard-vacuum chambers for soil on shoes

"Conclusion: Tau Ceti-e appears to be human-habitable, but I strongly recommend a period of physical development and ASR before the colonists are brought down. Even then, it may take a generation before humans are thoroughly acclimated to this world."

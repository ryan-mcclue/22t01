Sanctuary takes place in orbit around and on a planet named Tau Ceti-e. 
Is there really an exoplanet named Tau Ceti-e? 
Would you expect it to be habitable based on the description in the story? 
Why or why not?

Tau Ceti-e is a real exoplanet that orbits the star Tau Ceti in the Cetus constellation.
Considering Tau Ceti-e's distance from Tau Ceti, its mass and the mass of the Tau Ceti, it lies outside the 'habitable zone'. 
However, as discussed in the week 3 lectures, the 'habitable zone' is a myopic determination of what is actually habitable.
Specifically, the term habitable must be qualified with certain conditions for a clear understanding of what is meant.
From *Sanctuary's* description of Tau Ceti-e, I believe that it's not habitable due to the presence of 'The Rot'.
It's described as a "native microorganism that feeds on substances derived from organic petrochemicals" and "breaks down anything made of these kinds of plastic"
Whilst humans can survive without plastics as evidenced by our hominin ancestors, the environmental conditions of Tau Ceti-e outlined in *Sanctuary* dictates the need for plastics.

The initial scans of Tau Ceti-e reveal a surface gravity of 1.59g. 
As this is higher than Earth's, some form of space suit will be required to prevent the negative effects of a high-g environment on the human body.

Furthering the necessity of the spacesuit is the atmospheric composition.

Currently there is no technology that exists that could provide the same functionality as their plastic counterparts.

The ship requires plastic to prevent radiation (source), cushioning (source)
long distance biostasis plastic used for medical care trachea-pipe
Plastics involved with wiring insulation and PCB construction

"strongly recommend a period of physical development"

having to take into account the various inaccuracies of probe and having contingencies, 
e.g. treadmills becoming essential (not suitable for people with underlying health conditions), 
paper and pen over electronics due to Rot, lifeboats, medical equipment
determination of intelligent life can not be made with confidence prior to landing. this can causes disruptions upon arrival
having personnel with particular skillsets to handle contingencies, e.g. psychological for first contact, PT for high-g

biostatis imposes limtations of what can be done - "left undecided until all the passengers on both ships are revived"

atmosphere sufficient levels of oxygen
higher surface gravity (coupled with prolonged period in microgravity)
lower atmospheric pressure (cloudiness, wet weather, less sun; more gasses can escape to atmosphere). thin but breathable, no strenous
temperature similar, yet no real middleground (fine for living though)
plant life containing suitable left-handed amino acids

evidence of life, however not detected by probes due to low level fossil fuel emission (not above threshold); so human activity may not work well
"spectrographic evidence of large-scale use of fossil fuels"
financial cost to maintain equipment, e.g. radiation and hard-vacuum chambers for soil on shoes

microorganisms affecting organic materials (components and artificial fibre clothing)

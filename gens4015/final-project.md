# Final Project (bibliography relating to scientific principles mentioned, maybe also mention lecture slides?)

Developments in science and technology are inextricably linked to changes 
in the human condition.
In the early 21st century, what it means to be human is to interact with nature, 
be in touch with your emotions and to be modest.
Joe Haldeman's novel *The Forever War*, James Gray's 2019 film *Ad Astra* and 
Ridley Scott's 1982 film *Blade Runner* put forward the notion that 
the pursuit of scientific advancements challenges what it means to be human.
To make this assertion, the texts explore how the evolution of scientific practices
results in the disruption of nature, emotional isolation and hubristic ideology.

In *The Forever War*, scientific advancements are pursued in order to 
help win the war against an alien race known as the Taurans. The desire to create the ultimate
war machine disrupts the soldier's interation with nature, 
thereby challenging what it means to be human.
Advancements in neuroscience enable the United Nations Exploratory Force
to impose extreme pychological manipulation and mind conditioning on the soldiers.
The ability to selectively reinforce or destroy the electrical connections 
between the neurons and synapses in the soldier's brains allows for this thought control.
Soldiers have their sense of empathy for the Taurans overridden 
so they aren't 'held back' by the natural human instinct of compassion.
Furthermore, the general population are directed to view natural heterosexuality as
sociopathic and are controlled towards homosexuality in order to control birth rates. 
[some comment here ...]
Advancements in biology and genetic engineering allow the United Nations to create a global
eugenics council that controls all production of human life.
An egg can be artificially fertilised with sperm and then introduced to an artificial womb,
removing the need of a natural birth arising from intercourse.
Furthermore, genomes can be altered to ensure specific traits in individuals, rather
than relying on the natural randomness of DNA inheritance.
Extending beyond this disruption of the natural creation of life is the warping of a human's
natural upbringing. There is no concept of a parent and adolescent years are spent in an 
institution away from the general population.
[some comment here ...]
It's clear that the scientific advancements in neuroscience, biology and genetic engineering 
disrupt the natural processes of thought and reproduction and therefore challenge what it
means to be human.

The scientific advancements utilised in the war with the Taurens in *The Forever War*,
creates an environment in which individuals are subjected to emotional isolation. 
This challenges what it means to be human.
Advancements in aerospace engineering have created propulsions systems capable of sustaining 
speeds close to the speed of light. Furthermore, the technology to allow humans 
to survive extremely high-g environments in order to acheive such high speeds in short
periods of time have been developed.
As a consequence of Einstein's theory of relativity, when a system contains velocities
approaching lightspeed, time dilation is experienced. 
From the perspective of those on Earth, time moves faster, resulting
in [insert actual quote] 25 Earth years equating to 2 years for those travelling near the
speed of light.
[insert a comment here]
Advancements in computing have allowed for computers to control most aspects of life.
A reduction in the size of transistors and memory cells allows for accelerated speeds 
as you are able to fit more computational and storage units onto a smaller surface area of 
silicon.

2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Extreme time dilation makes it impossible to maintain social bonds outside of the Army.
    Army deliberately moves squad members around to prevent developing relationships.
    Forced to to 'sack' (have sex) with members of your squad every night.
    Emotions are reduced to physical releases that you don't become attuned with.
    Desensitisation to death and suffering.
  * All interactions dominated by computers and machinery (at their mercy)
    Spaceships and major weapons are almost exclusively controlled by a computer. 
    Physical acts like running and walking overriden by enhanced space suit.
    Education controlled with automated learning systems.


In *Ad Astra*, scientific advancements are pursued in order to 
develop interstellar travel and knowledge of life in the universe.
The promotion of individualism as a successful mentality for celestial science 
leads to a society with a hubristic frame of mind, challenging what it means to be human.
Advancements in aerospace engineering have allowed humans to spend large amounts of time in 
space. Improved cosmic radiation protection and technology to inhibit the negative affects of 
prolonged exposure to microgravity means humans can better sustain the harsh environment of space.
Because of this extended time in space, Space Force exerts itself as an authoritarian figure.
Media censorship and propaganda is rife, with those few in command believing they know what's best for everyone.
Space Force attempts to create a false sense of reality to reaffirm the supposed positives of what they are doing
"The moon. Where the world comes together". This is despite the moon containing disputed territories and being in a state of war.
Due to the fact that Clifford embodied the egotism of Space Force, he was selected as leader for the Lima Project and marketed as a hero.
As the Lima Project was the figurehead of Space Force excellence, others were encouraged to adopt Clifford's excessive self assurance if they
wanted to succeed.
However, Roy's journey to discover what has become of the Lima Project reveals that the blind pursuit of a goal deteriorates your humanity.
Whilst on the Mars base, Roy is told the uncensored events that led to the marooning of the Lima Project at Neptune.
Clifford killed the other crew members who wanted to go back to Earth due to negative results, as he believed they were "".
Demonstrating the widespread nature of conceited individuals in Space Force is Roy's actions on Mars.
He is portrayed as a very mild-mannered individual yet he illegally boards and takes control of the ship to Neptune, thinking only he can get the job done.
Once he reaches the Lima Project, Roy realises that his father's arrogance has taken his humanity when he says
"I never once thought of home. I never cared about you or your mother and your small ideas". 

the severe sacrifices required to search beyond left Roy's father with no desire to live in the real world. 
'could only see what wasn't there, not what was right in front of him' imbued with such a will to achieve a goal, 
things that don't satisfy this are discarded at the detriment of oneself

The scientific advancements employed by Space Force in *Ad Astra*
produce an emotionally isolating workplace for its employees, challenging
what it means to be human.
Advancements in psychology have allowed the ability to reliably determine someone's 
mood/emotion from sensor readings.
Performing calculations on the numerous microscopic variations in a person's vital signs, 
vocal tones, pupil activity and body language gives an impression of their current disposition.
Such technology results in Space Force performing psychological assessments via a machine
that asks questions to the subject. On failure, you enter a solitary 'comfort room'.
No human interaction is present and what should be a back and forth exchange of emotions 
becomes a mere relying of information.
Roy represents the incredibly emotionally detached state within Space Force.
Roy's complete lack of emotional responses is valued by Space Force, 
when he is commended for his pulse never going above 80 [quote here].
Roy's frequent voice-overs, closeup shots and relationship flashbacks 
further emphasis his emotional anaemia
Room interiors are all muted colours. Soundtrack is monotonous and steady.
'I see myself from the outside'; 'it's all a performance'
when asked how he handled his father's absence he only mentions how it affected his mother; 
he can only describe emotions by relating how they are experienced in others

all the bases are neutral colour schemes, 
dim lighting, basic shapes like cubes; furnished with only the essential; purely functional

ever repeating Roy voice-over to emphasis his lonliness/isolation.

repeated phrase to ensure passing is 
"I'm focused on the essential to the exclusion of all else" 




In *Blade Runner*, scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop 
synthetic intelligent life. The absence of natural life is an undeniable disruption of nature
and therefore challenge to what it means to be human.
Advancements in bio-engineering have allowed for the ability to grow artificial organs.
Stem cells can be grown on scaffolds specific to the particular organ desired.
The role of a conventional doctor has been replaced by a genetic designer as evidenced in the
scene with Hannibal Chew and the Replicants, where Chew remarks "I design your eyes".
Advancements in robotics have allowed for fluid, human-like movements to be performed by robots.
Improvements in multiple feedback loop systems are acheived, so as to create agents that have a 
changing centre of gravity.
The ability to emulate nature results in society devaluing the importance of natural things. This leads
to the removal of all things natural.
Wide angle shots of the environment show excessive pollution, towering machinery, 
dirty streets with no trees or greenery.
The majority of the movie is filmed in dark lighting with accompanying fog, which obscures any living details. 
From this, we can see the vast deterioration of the natural world.
The soundtrack employs digital synthesisers with no physical instruments, demonstrating the extent to which even natural music has been replaced.
When Deckard asks Rachel about the composition of her owl "is it artificial?" her blunt response
"of course" demonstrates the dim resignation society has towards the natural being replaced.

The scientific advancements prevalent throughout society in *Blade Runner*
create a civilisation that is emotionally isolated, thus challenging what it means to be human.
Advancements in artificial intelligence have allowed for agents to learn and adapt to complex 
and unpredictable situations.
An increase in the speed of machine learning algorithms used greatly decreases the time taken 
for an agent to make an informed decision.
As Replicants embody these advancements, synthetic life is able to develop emotion.
As the Replicant's are artificial, their emotional expressions are viewed as artificial by 
society also. The end result is a society that devalues the importance of emotion.
The opening of the film which describes the '4 year fail-safe' (termination) builtin to the 
Replicants is evident of society's disregard for their ability to develop emotion.
The dehumanising slurs to refer to the Replicants like 'skinjob' and 'skinner' serves to 
further enhance this state of affairs. 
Throughout the film, the Replicant's emotions serve as a dichotomy to humanity's lack thereof.
Roy expresses sorrow after the loss of Pris, Leon demonstrates devotion to the Replicant's plight
and Zora shows amorous desires in her work. 
Deckard's isolated, emotionally anemic life is symbolic of humanity. 
There are no scenes of him in a social setting, only work.
He is awkward and uncomforting relaying emotional information to Rachel.
When subject to an event of high emotional impact, such as when he shoots Zora or witnesses Roy's 
animalistic howling, he undergoes physical shakes instead of healthy emotional expressions. 
Even J.F Sebastian, the only human who shows any signs of happiness views emotions as a mechanical construct "I make my friends".
[]

In conclusion, it's evident that in *The Forever War*, *Ad Astra* and *Blade Runner*,
the 21st century definition of what it means to be human is questioned. 
The texts investigate how scientific progressions lead to the disruption of nature, 
emotional isolation and hubristic ideology.
This investigation reaffirms the idea that the pursuit of scientific advancements challenges 
what it means to be human.

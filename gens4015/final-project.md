# Final Project (bibliography relating to scientific principles mentioned, maybe also mention lecture slides?)

Developments in science and technology are inextricably linked to changes 
in the human condition.
In the early 21st century, what it means to be human is to interact with nature, 
be in touch with your emotions and to be modest.
Joe Haldeman's novel *The Forever War*, James Gray's 2019 film *Ad Astra* and 
Ridley Scott's 1982 film *Blade Runner* put forward the notion that 
the pursuit of scientific advancements challenges what it means to be human.
To make this assertion, the texts explore how the evolution of scientific practices
results in the disruption of nature, emotional isolation and hubristic ideology.

In *The Forever War*, scientific advancements are pursued in order to 
help win the war against an alien race known as the Taurans. The desire to create the ultimate
war machine disrupts the soldier's interation with nature, 
thereby challenging what it means to be human.
Advancements in neuroscience enable the United Nations Exploratory Force
to impose extreme pychological manipulation and mind conditioning on the soldiers.
The ability to selectively reinforce or destroy the electrical connections 
between the neurons and synapses in the soldier's brains allows for this thought control.
Soldiers have their sense of empathy for the Taurans overridden 
so they aren't 'held back' by the natural human instinct of compassion.
Furthermore, the general population are directed to view natural heterosexuality as
sociopathic and are controlled towards homosexuality in order to control birth rates.

Advancements in biology and genetic engineering allow the United Nations to create a global
eugenics council that controls all production of human life.
An egg can be artificially fertilised with sperm and then introduced to an artificial womb,
removing the need of a natural birth arising from intercourse.
Furthermore, genomes can be altered to ensure specific traits in individuals, rather
than relying on the natural randomness of DNA inheritance.
Extending beyond this disruption of the natural creation of life is the warping of a human's
natural upbringing. There is no concept of a parent and adolescent years are spent in an 
institution away from the general population.

It's clear that the scientific advancements in neuroscience, biology and genetic engineering 
disrupt the natural processes of thought and reproduction and therefore challenge what it
means to be human.

The scientific advancements utilised in the war with the Taurens in *The Forever War*,
creates an environment in which individuals are subjected to emotional isolation. 
This challenges what it means to be human.
Advancements in aerospace engineering have created propulsions systems capable of sustaining 
speeds close to the speed of light. Furthermore, the technology to allow humans 
to survive extremely high-g environments in order to acheive such high speeds in short
periods of time have been developed.
As a consequence of Einstein's theory of relativity, when a system contains velocities
approaching lightspeed, time dilation is experienced. 
From the perspective of those on Earth, time moves faster, resulting
in [insert actual quote] 25 Earth years equating to 2 years for those travelling near the
speed of light.

Advancements in computing have allowed for computers to control most aspects of life.
A reduction in the size of transistors and memory cells allows for accelerated speeds 
as you are able to fit more computational and storage units onto a smaller surface area of 
silicon.

2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Extreme time dilation makes it impossible to maintain social bonds outside of the Army.
    Army deliberately moves squad members around to prevent developing relationships.
    Forced to to 'sack' (have sex) with members of your squad every night.
    Emotions are reduced to physical releases that you don't become attuned with.
    Desensitisation to death and suffering.
  * All interactions dominated by computers and machinery (at their mercy)
    Spaceships and major weapons are almost exclusively controlled by a computer. 
    Physical acts like running and walking overriden by enhanced space suit.
    Education controlled with automated learning systems.


In *Ad Astra*, scientific advancements are pursued in order to 
develop interstellar travel and knowledge of life in the universe.
The promotion of individualism as a successful mentality for celestial science 
leads to a society with a hubristic frame of mind, challenging what it means to be human.
Advancements in aerospace engineering have allowed humans to spend large amounts of time in 
space. Improved cosmic radiation protection and technology to inhibit the negative affects of 
prolonged exposure to microgravity means humans can better sustain the harsh environment of space.

1. Man's Hubris:
  * Media censorship and propaganda rife in Space Force and on Earth. 
    The few in command believe they know what's best for everyone to acheive a better society.
    Roy is told lies about his father so that he is still motivated to continue work
  * Clifford's vanity meant he was in strong alignment with Space Force's message and so was selected as leader for the Lima project.
    He was the figurehead of Space Force excellence, promoting others to adopt his excessive self assurance in order to succeed 
    Even mild-mannered Roy adopts this mindset, as he illegally boards the ship to Neptune, thinking only he can get the job done


The scientific advancements employed by Space Force in *Ad Astra*
produce an emotionally isolating workplace for its employees, challenging
what it means to be human.
Advancements in psychology have allowed the ability to reliably determine someone's 
mood/emotion from sensor readings.
Performing calculations on the numerous microscopic variations in a person's vital signs, 
vocal tones, pupil activity and body language gives an impression of their current disposition.

2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Roy's complete lack of emotional responses is valued by Space Force, e.g. his pulse never going above 80 is commended.
    Roy's frequent voice-overs, closeup shots and relationship flashbacks further emphasis his emotional anaemia
    Room interiors are all muted colours. Soundtrack is monotonous and steady.
  * Psychological assessments are performed by a machine asking questions and subject speaking into an microphone.
    A repeated phrase to ensure passing is "I'm focused on the essential to the exclusion of all else" 
    On failure, you enter a solitary 'comfort room'. No human contact or emotional discussions. 



In *Blade Runner*, scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop 
synthetic intelligent life. The absence of natural life is an undeniable disruption of nature
and therefore challenge to what it means to be human.

1. Disruption of Nature:
  * Shots of environment show excessive pollution, towering machinery, dirty streets, dark mottled skies and no trees or greenery.
    No natural light. All animals are artifical, epitomised with the existence of the Replicants.
    Soundtrack uses digital synthesisers, no physical instruments.
    Engineers now manufacturer body parts instead of doctors treating individuals.

  * Advancements in bio-engineering have allowed for the ability to grow artificial organs.
    Stem cells can be grown on scaffolds specific to the particular organ desired.


The scientific advancements prevalent throughout society in *Blade Runner*
create a civilisation that is emotionally isolated, thus challenging what it means to be human.

2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Deckard is portrayed as a loner. No scenes of him in a social setting, all work.
    Deckard's work colleagues show no concern for his wellbeing.
    Deckard himself is awkward and uncomforting relaying emotional information.
    When Deckard is subject to an event of high emotional impact, he undergoes physical shakes instead of healthy emotional expressions. 
  * Disregarding their ability to develop emotion, builtin to the Replicants is a '4 year fail-safe' that will shut them down after 4 years.
    Non-complying Replicants are sought for termination, not execution. This choice of words, along with slurs like 'skinjob' serves to dehumanise them.
    The Replicants exhibit varied emotions such as compassion, fear, anger and a desire to live.
    The Replicants emotions serve as a dichotomy to humanity's lack thereof.

  * Advancements in robotics have allowed for fluid, human-like movements to be performed by robots.
    Improvements in multiple feedback loop systems to create agents that have a centre of gravity that changes as they move.
  * Advancements in artificial intelligence have allowed for agents to learn and adapt to complex and unpredictable situations.
    An increase in speed of machine learning algorithms used greatly decreases the time taken for an agent to make an informed decision.

In conclusion, it's evident that in *The Forever War*, *Ad Astra* and *Blade Runner*,
the 21st century definition of what it means to be human is questioned. 
The texts investigate how scientific progressions lead to the disruption of nature, 
emotional isolation and hubristic ideology.
This investigation reaffirms the idea that the pursuit of scientific advancements challenges 
what it means to be human.

# Final Project (bibliography relating to scientific principles mentioned, maybe also mention lecture slides?)

Developments in science and technology are inextricably linked to changes 
in the human condition.
In the early 21st century, what it means to be human is to interact with nature, 
be in touch with your emotions and to be modest.
Joe Haldeman's novel *The Forever War*, James Gray's 2019 film *Ad Astra* and 
Ridley Scott's 1982 film *Blade Runner* put forward the notion that 
the pursuit of scientific advancements challenges what it means to be human.
To make this assertion, the texts explore how the evolution of scientific practices
results in the disruption of nature, emotional isolation and hubristic ideology.

In *The Forever War*, scientific advancements are pursued in order to 
help win the war against an alien race known as the Taurans. The desire to create the ultimate
war machine disrupts humanity's interation with nature, challenging what it means to be human.

1. Disruption of Nature:
  * Extreme pychological manipulation and mind conditioning to alter natural thought processes.
    Soldiers have  their sense of empathy overridden in order to evoke intense hatred for the Taurans in battle.
    General population is controlled towards homosexuality in order to control birth rates. Heterosexuality viewed as sociopathic.
  * No natural births. No concept of a parent. Adolescent years spent in an institution.
    Eugenics council controls all production of life, ensuring everyone has similar traits. 
    Eventually everyone is a clone.
  * All interactions dominated by computers and machinery (at their mercy)
    Spaceships and major weapons are almost exclusively controlled by a computer. 
    Physical acts like running and walking overriden by enhanced space suit.
    Education controlled with automated learning systems.

  * Advancements in neuroscience have allowed for extreme pychological manipulation and mind conditioning.
    The ability to selectively reinforce or destroy the electrical connections between the neurons and synapses in our brains allows for thought control.
  * Advancements in biology have allowed for no natural births.
    An egg is artificially fertilised with sperm and then introduced to an artificial womb.
  * Advancements in genetic engineering have allowed for ensuring everyone has similar traits.
    This is acheived by altering the genomes of living organisms.




2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Extreme time dilation makes it impossible to maintain social bonds outside of the Army.
    Army deliberately moves squad members around to prevent developing relationships.
    Forced to to 'sack' (have sex) with members of your squad every night.
    Emotions are reduced to physical releases that you don't become attuned with.
  * Desensitisation to death and suffering.
    The idea of a private dying in training or later on a mission is commonplace and underwhelming.
    On Earth, medical priority levels so only certain individuals get treatment.
    Individualism is discarded. Only duty and results matter.


  * Advancements in computing have allowed for computers to control most aspects of life.
    The reduction in size of transistors and memory cells allows for improved computational power by being able to fit more onto a piece of silicon.
  * Advancements in aerospace-engineering have allowed for spaceships to travel at speeds close to the speed of light.
    Propulsion systems capable of sustaining the energy required to travel so fast, as well as technology to aid humans surviving high-g environments to accelerate to this speed in short amount of time.


In *Ad Astra*, scientific advancements are pursued in order to 
develop interstellar travel and knowledge of life in the universe.
1. Man's Hubris:
  * Media censorship and propaganda rife in Space Force and on Earth. 
    The few in command believe they know what's best for everyone to acheive a better society.
    Roy is told lies about his father so that he is still motivated to continue work
  * Clifford's vanity meant he was in strong alignment with Space Force's message and so was selected as leader for the Lima project.
    He was the figurehead of Space Force excellence, promoting others to adopt his excessive self assurance in order to succeed 
    Even mild-mannered Roy adopts this mindset, as he illegally boards the ship to Neptune, thinking only he can get the job done
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Roy's complete lack of emotional responses is valued by Space Force, e.g. his pulse never going above 80 is commended.
    Roy's frequent voice-overs, closeup shots and relationship flashbacks further emphasis his emotional anaemia
    Room interiors are all muted colours. Soundtrack is monotonous and steady.
  * Psychological assessments are performed by a machine asking questions and subject speaking into an microphone.
    A repeated phrase to ensure passing is "I'm focused on the essential to the exclusion of all else" 
    On failure, you enter a solitary 'comfort room'. No human contact or emotional discussions. 

  * Advancements in aerospace-engineering have allowed humans to spend a large amount of time in space.
    Improved cosmic radiation protection and technology to inhibit the negative affects of prolonged exposure to microgravity (such as electric muscle stimulants)
  * Advancements in neuroscience have allowed the ability to reliably determine someone's mood/emotion from sensor readings.
    Detecting variations in a person's vital signs, vocal tones, pupil activity, body language etc.


In *Blade Runner*, scientific advancements are pursued in order to 
develop synthetic intelligent life.
1. Disruption of Nature:
  * Shots of environment show excessive pollution, towering machinery, dirty streets, dark mottled skies and no trees or greenery.
    No natural light. All animals are artifical, epitomised with the existence of the Replicants.
    Soundtrack uses digital synthesisers, no physical instruments.
    Engineers now manufacturer body parts instead of doctors treating individuals.
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Deckard is portrayed as a loner. No scenes of him in a social setting, all work.
    Deckard's work colleagues show no concern for his wellbeing.
    Deckard himself is awkward and uncomforting relaying emotional information.
    When Deckard is subject to an event of high emotional impact, he undergoes physical shakes instead of healthy emotional expressions. 
  * Disregarding their ability to develop emotion, builtin to the Replicants is a '4 year fail-safe' that will shut them down after 4 years.
    Non-complying Replicants are sought for termination, not execution. This choice of words, along with slurs like 'skinjob' serves to dehumanise them.
    The Replicants exhibit varied emotions such as compassion, fear, anger and a desire to live.
    The Replicants emotions serve as a dichotomy to humanity's lack thereof.

  * Advancements in robotics have allowed for fluid, human-like movements to be performed by robots.
    Improvements in multiple feedback loop systems to create agents that have a centre of gravity that changes as they move.
  * Advancements in artificial intelligence have allowed for agents to learn and adapt to complex and unpredictable situations.
    An increase in speed of machine learning algorithms used greatly decreases the time taken for an agent to make an informed decision.
  * Advancements in bio-engineering have allowed for the ability to grow artificial organs.
    Stem cells can be grown on scaffolds specific to the particular organ desired.

The milky way orbits a black hole

The three-body problem refers to the difficulty in resolving the orbital paths of 3 objects

Spacetime is viewing space and time as conjoined.

Einstein's general relativity has superseded Newton's universal gravitation. 
Gravity is determined by the curvature of space time. Mass causes this curvature.

How an object accelerates affects how it experiences gravity. 
An accelerating mass will propagate gravitional waves at the speed of light.
So, the Sun sends out gravitational waves that travel at the speed of light.
Therefore, Earth is attracted to where the Sun was ~8 minutes ago.

Affects of curved spacetime:
1. Under the influence of an extreme gravitational field, time slows down (gravitational time dilation)
2. Gravitational lensing is a large distribution of matter that is capable of bending light from source to observer.

The stronger the gravitational field (i.e, the more space time is curved), the slower time passes for you relative to an observer

However, time is also affected when an object moves (speed of light is constant, special relativity)
Faster you move, relative to an observer: 
 - time passes slower
 - length contracts
 - mass gets larger

The habitable zone is range of orbits around a star that a planet could support liquid water
Eventually Earth will lose its magentic field when the inner core solidifies (like on the moon and Mars)

TODO: What is parallax and parsecs?
IMPORTANT: Carl Zimmer interview is to understand the 'rules' that make good scientific writing, i.e. does it make it interesting, accessible and worth knowing.
Hopefully have the reader leave with a new understanding/viewpoint of the universe/world

IMPORTANT: Harvard style references at end of writing assignments
Time always moves forward (although theoretically possible to go backwards, it requires extreme space time curvature, like a black hole, so not practical)
Non-reversible processes (most processes), i.e. most processes in the universe have a direction associated with them (not symmetric under time)
Something like ice-melting is not going to spontaneously undo itself 
Energy is only useful when clumped together. when you use it, it becomes more spread out. So, entropy is a measure of how spread out your energy is.
Entropy can also be thought of how disordered a system is, e.g. ice has a highly organised crystalline structure, when becomes water molecules more spread out, i.e. entropy increased
Entropy is always increasing. There is constantly many non-reversible reactions going on from the microscopic (fusion) to macroscopic (breathing, eating, etc.)
Nuclear fusion powers stars and is when two nucleui merge to form another of less mass overall, but heavier individually e.g. 4 hydrogen into helium, thereby releasing excess energy (e=mc^2)
Almost all elements in the universe formed in stars
Time going forward is linked with increase in entropy. So, when all actions to increase entropy have occurred (trillions of years), time ceases to be relevent 
White dwarf is the remnant core of a dead star that has run out of fuel. It's extremely dense.
A supernova is an explosion that occurs because of instabilities or mergers.
Type 1 requires at least one white dwarf involved in a merger
Type 2 is when a massive star gets to a point where its producing too heavy elements that results in a loss of energy, e.g. iron. 
The energy the star requires to combat gravity is gone, so it collapses and all the protons and electrons form to neutrons. This releases a huge amount of energy.
There are up to 3 different remnants from this type 2 supernova; a neutron star, nothing or black hole
Stellar flares are when a star's magnetic field lines realign and release a large amount of energy and eject material at high speed. They are also accompanied by the emission of x-rays, gamma-rays and plasma.
Fortunately, Earth's magnetic field and ozone protect us from this
Radio jets are material spewing from the centre of a galaxy close to the speed of light and emitting strong radio waves (so black holes can also eject, i.e. driving these jets)

We know universe is expanding by measuring doppler shift of other galaxies in the universe. The doppler effect tells us that waves emitting from a moving source in the direction of motion, i.e. in front, will be squished together and behind will be stretched out.
Blue light has a shorter wavelength, red longer. So, a galaxy moving away from us will appear redder than it really is, i.e. is redshifted
We notice that all galaxies are moving away from us. The further away they are, the faster they are moving (we postulate dark energy is responsible for this)
Because of this expansion, we could say the universe will last for infinity. However, it will be rather bleak say trillions of years from now, with stars using all their energy.
The state of the universe trillions of years from now is not an exact science. It's an example of in science where people's interpretations/world-view's reach different conclusions
By calculating the doppler velocity, we can tell approximatley how long ago the universe was at its singularity (around 14 billion years)

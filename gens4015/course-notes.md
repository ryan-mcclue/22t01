The milky way orbits a black hole

The three-body problem refers to the difficulty in resolving the orbital paths of 3 objects

Spacetime is viewing space and time as conjoined.

Einstein's general relativity has superseded Newton's universal gravitation. 
Gravity is determined by the curvature of space time. Mass causes this curvature.

How an object accelerates affects how it experiences gravity. 
An accelerating mass will propagate gravitional waves at the speed of light.
So, the Sun sends out gravitational waves that travel at the speed of light.
Therefore, Earth is attracted to where the Sun was ~8 minutes ago.

Affects of curved spacetime:
1. Under the influence of an extreme gravitational field, time slows down (gravitational time dilation)
2. Gravitational lensing is a large distribution of matter that is capable of bending light from source to observer.

The stronger the gravitational field (i.e, the more space time is curved), the slower time passes for you relative to an observer

However, time is also affected when an object moves (speed of light is constant, special relativity)
Faster you move, relative to an observer: 
 - time passes slower
 - length contracts
 - mass gets larger

The habitable zone is range of orbits around a star that a planet could support liquid water
Eventually Earth will lose its magentic field when the inner core solidifies (like on the moon and Mars)

Proxima Centuri closest star. Magellic clouds dwarf galaxies orbitting milky way. Andromeda closest galaxy

TODO: What is parallax and parsecs?

IMPORTANT: Carl Zimmer interview is to understand the 'rules' that make good scientific writing, i.e. does it make it interesting, accessible and worth knowing.
Hopefully have the reader leave with a new understanding/viewpoint of the universe/world

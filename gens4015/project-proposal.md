# GENS4015 Project Proposal
Of the five prescribed novels, I have chosen *The Forever War*, Joe Haldeman.
As my two supporting materials, I have chosen *Ad Astra*, 2019 film directed by James Gray and *Blade Runner*, 1982 film directed by Ridley Scott.
The thesis of my project is: **The pursuit of scientific advancements challenges what it means to be human**
My project will take the form of a persuasive essay.
In support of my thesis, I will discuss these three topics:
## The Forever War:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to help win the war with the Taurans
1. Disruption of Nature:
 * Extreme pychological manipulation is employed on the soldiers 
   to override their sense of empathy and evoke intense hatred for the Taurans on the battlefield.
   Mind conditioning population to become homosexual and view heterosexuality as sociopathic.
 * No natural births. No concept of a parent. Adolescent years spent in an institution.
   Eugenics council controls all production of life, ensuring everyone has similar traits 
 * everything interacted via computers and machinery?
2. Emotional Isolation:
 * Extreme time dilation makes it impossible to maintain social bonds, emotional  having no social alienation (called queer)

## Ad Astra:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop interstellar travel and knowledge of life in the universe 
1. Disruption of Nature:
2. Emotional Isolation:

## Blade Runner:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop synthetic intelligent life
1. Disruption of Nature:
2. Emotional Isolation:

(loss of value of life, attempting to play God)

technology that gives society everything it wants, but makes humans more emotionally isolated than ever

# GENS4015 Project Proposal
Of the five prescribed novels, I have chosen *The Forever War*, Joe Haldeman.
As my two supporting materials, I have chosen *Ad Astra*, 2019 film directed by James Gray and *Blade Runner*, 1982 film directed by Ridley Scott.
The thesis of my project is: **The pursuit of scientific advancements challenges what it means to be human**
My project will take the form of a persuasive essay.
In support of my thesis, I will discuss these topics:
## The Forever War:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to help win the war with the Taurans
1. Disruption of Nature:
  * Extreme pychological manipulation is employed on the soldiers 
    to override their sense of empathy and evoke intense hatred for the Taurans on the battlefield.
    Mind conditioning population to become homosexual and view heterosexuality as sociopathic.
  * No natural births. No concept of a parent. Adolescent years spent in an institution.
    Eugenics council controls all production of life, ensuring everyone has similar traits 
  * everything interacted via computers and machinery?
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Extreme time dilation makes it impossible to maintain social bonds outside of the Army.
    Army deliberately moves squad members around to prevent developing relationships.
    No one to talk to and share thoughts with
  * UN organises everything, stifling individulism
  * Desensitisation to death (hospital, training)

## Ad Astra:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop interstellar travel and knowledge of life in the universe 
1. Man's Hubris:
  * Deceiving Roy of his true purpose ...
    Lying to him about his father (we know whats best) ...
    Propaganda to reinforce what they are doing is right ...
  * Clifford taking control of Lima project (he was selected/screened as a visionary yet these traits that positioned him as an instrument of progress)
    Likewise with Roy boarding ship to Neptune (become so engrained thinks only he can get the job done) 
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Roy's lack of emotional response, i.e. pulse never going above 80 is commended.
    Constant monologues; only scenes of him with others are flashbacks, indicative of lack of expression
    Room interiors are all muted ... soundtrack motonous
  * Psychological assessments are performed by a machine.
    When failed, you enter a 'comfort room' ...
## Blade Runner:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop synthetic intelligent life
1. Disruption of Nature:
  * Environment is polluted, machinery; soundtrack synthesised; all animals artifical; doctors are now engineers ...
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * No scenes of Deckard with friends; no concern for his emotional distress just duty
  physical shakes instead of communication of emotions (unhealthy expression of emotion)
  * 4-year failsafe termination of Replicants disregards their ability to develop emotion
  They show varied emotions contrasting to others who show none;
  show desire to live

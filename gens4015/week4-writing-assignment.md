Aspects of habitability that are important but not included in the idea of the "habitable zone"? 
Feel free to discuss habitability for humans, Earth life, life in general, or all of the above.

As defined in the lecture slides, the 'habitable zone' is the orbital distance where a planet could have liquid water on its surface.
However, this definition does not take into account a number of complex factors such as habitability for humans, Earth life and life in general.
1. Habitability for Humans:

2. Earth Life:

People require a purpose to exist. If cannot do anything but stay indoors, etc.

3. Life in General:
The term 'habitable zone' is not specific as to what forms of life find the environment habitable.
Just on Earth, there are a variety of life forms that can survive under drastically different conditions than humans.
The Aquifex genus of bacteria can survive temperatures up to 96°C and the psychrophiles microbes can survive as low as -15°C.
A loriciferan of the genus Spinoloricus can survive without oxygen and the Deinococcus radiodurans bacterium can survive 1500 times more radiation than humans.

Furthermore, as remarked upon in *Sorry, 'Earth 2.0' Fans* "Hotter planets could have life thriving in their upper atmospheres; colder planets could have life thriving beneath a surface of ice"

## Colonize Mars
"conversation is focused only on the possible promises of a Mars colonization, not the potential perils"
"safeguard against polluting the red planet"
"Will the Mars emigrants extract life-supporting resources from Earth to make life on humanity’s new home possible"

## Sorry Earth fans

"does the presence of life influence the biosphere?"

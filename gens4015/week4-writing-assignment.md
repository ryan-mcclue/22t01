Aspects of habitability that are important but not included in the idea of the "habitable zone"? 
Feel free to discuss habitability for humans, Earth life, life in general, or all of the above.

As defined in the lecture slides, the 'habitable zone' is the orbital distance where a planet could have liquid water on its surface.
However, this definition does not take into account a number of complex factors such as habitability for humans, Earth life and life in general.

The term 'habitable zone' may include exoplanets with extreme environmental conditions that humans could not easily survive in.
There could be extreme volcanic activity on the planet's surface causing serious respiratory issues from gases such as sulphur dioxide and environmental damage from erupted materials.
A serious greenhouse effect may be present as touched on in *Sorry, 'Earth 2.0' Fans* "Does the presence of life influence the biosphere?" and *Colonize Mars?* "safeguard against polluting the red planet"
If this were the case, inevitable greenhouse gas emission could see planet temperatures skyrocket.
Furthermore, the planet could be entirely liquid water. In this situation, an almost infeasible amount of infrastruture would be required to support large numbers of humans. 

The term 'habitable zone' does not take into account the various social structures that have developed on Earth and that have become integral parts of human life.
conditions required for long term living
Is artificially creating these things viable?
On Earth, there a number of setup
What is necessary (socially, mentally, architecturally) for living long term
People require a purpose to exist. If cannot do anything but stay indoors, etc.

The term 'habitable zone' is not specific as to what forms of life find the environment habitable.
Just on Earth, there are a variety of life forms that can survive under drastically different conditions than humans.
The Aquifex genus of bacteria can survive temperatures up to 96°C and the psychrophiles microbes can survive as low as -15°C.
A loriciferan of the genus Spinoloricus can survive without oxygen and the Deinococcus radiodurans bacterium can survive 1500 times more radiation than humans.

Furthermore, as remarked upon in *Sorry, 'Earth 2.0' Fans* "Hotter planets could have life thriving in their upper atmospheres; colder planets could have life thriving beneath a surface of ice"

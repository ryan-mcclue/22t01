---------------------------------------------------------
The narrator in the Light Brigade undergoes a journey of self discovery. 
Their view of themselves as an independent thinker is challenged by the decisions they have made in relation to the war.
The narrator's desire for self-assurance is revealed in the introduction when they attempt to position themselves as a martyr "What happened to all those people doesn’t compare to what I have to do."
This need to convince themselves of their good intentions is further reinforced when they explain their reason for joining the war. 
They make a distinction between being motivated by 3rd party propaganda and first hand trauma "That’s what the networks say, and that’s what my CO says, but I’m here because they betrayed San Paulo."
Furthermore, phrases like "I'm a good soldier", "I'm not stupid" and "It wasn’t my fault" are indicative of the narrator's inner conflict.

The narrator's opinion of the aliens is initially one of disgust and anger. They show little remorse for the "I deal with it when bad things happen. So should she."
However, yet again the narrator's subconscious indecisvness kicks in when the vision still haunts them

The narrator's mindset begins to shift when they begin to suffer from neurosis. This almost psychodelic state makes them ponder the destruction of the hemisphere and change their outlook.

---------------------------------------------------------

They are aware of the realities of their position, knowing their not entirely altruistic. A degree of modesty

Heroism inspired joining after witnessing alien destruction of a place close to them (the propaganda did not convince them)

Willing to ignore inner questioning to adhere to the mold of a traditionalist macho soldier

Frequent vulgarity indicates their incredulaty and unwillingess to delve into the subject further 

Lack of empathy dealing with alien girl after hitting her legs. However, her sub-conscious remains conflicted with the memory of them screaming recurring in her mind

Constant questioning to the reader is reflective of them earnestly trying to convince themselves and absolve guilt. 
Also reaffirmations like 'I'm a good soldier', 'I'm not stupid', 'it wasn’t my fault' to show that they weren't brainwashed into joining a senseless war. Very insecure

Reference to 'we are light' as a last resort to imply that they can't be the bad ones

Not trusting the shrink or anyone. Furthers their need to reaffirm that their way of individual thinking is correct

A degree of neurosism in 'I was figuring things out. Things they didn't want us to understand'

Later accept that they are responsible for the war. The huge destruction of the northern hemisphere realised there unfounded ways
They clarify the vilified term 'alien' as a free-thinker. They forgive the San Paulo incident 
They say 'It was my lie. My betrayal' referencing giving up on their principles of self-evalution and not going with the herd.

Analyse the narrator in The Light Brigade. 
Why do they make the choices they do? 
What do they really think about the aliens and the war? 
Do those things change over the course of the story?

---------------------------------------------------------

They are aware of the realities of their position, knowing their not entirely altruistic. A degree of modesty

Heroism inspired joining after witnessing alien destruction of a place close to them (the propaganda did not convince them)

Willing to ignore inner questioning to adhere to the mold of a traditionalist macho soldier

Frequent vulgarity indicates their incredulaty and unwillingess to delve into the subject further 

Lack of empathy dealing with alien girl after hitting her legs. However, her sub-conscious remains conflicted with the memory of them screaming recurring in her mind

Constant questioning to the reader is reflective of them earnestly trying to convince themselves and absolve guilt. 
Also reaffirmations like 'I'm a good soldier', 'I'm not stupid' to show that they weren't brainwashed into joining a senseless war. Very insecure

Reference to 'we are light' as a last resort to imply that they can't be the bad ones

Not trusting the shrink or anyone. Furthers their need to reaffirm that their way of individual thinking is correct

A degree of neurosism in 'I was figuring things out. Things they didn't want us to understand'

Later accept that they are responsible for the war. The huge destruction of the northern hemisphere realised there unfounded ways
They clarify the vilified term 'alien' as a free-thinker. They forgive the San Paulo incident 
They say 'It was my lie. My betrayal' referencing giving up on their principles of self-evalution and not going with the herd.

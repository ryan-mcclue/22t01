Fixation of species questioned as travelled and discovered other fossils/animals.

non-western knowledge prior, however no formalisation of it so stays hidden

species is homo sapiens. 
genus is homo (things that have a lot in common). 
family is hominidae
order is primates
class is mammals

genome is the entire genetic makeup of individual

natural selection due to competition (fitness is environment specific)
Evolution is not directional, e.g. peppered moths

Selective pressures from selective agents

rate of fertility important, e.g. bacteria (single-celled)

a cell is fundamental unit of life

eukaroytic cells:
  * nucleus --> DNA (23 pairs of chromosomes; 23rd are XY in males, XX in females), RNA (copy DNA information to ribosome)
  * cytoplasm --> mitochondria (energy and mtDNA), ribosomes (protein synthesis)
    * somatic cells --> body tissue
    * gametes --> reproduction (egg cells and sperm cells forming zygote)

DNA governs cellular activity.
sugars and phosphates form sides, complementary bases (A, G, T, C) form rungs. 
nucleotide is one individual side
three bases (triplet or codon) form a recipe for a protein. so, DNA produces proteins

gene is a sequence of DNA bases. 

mapping the human genome means that we have identified particular sections of a chromosome that are responsible for particular traits.
so, alterations within the bases of these sections (alleles) will produce variations of this trait

mitosis is splitting into 2 new cells in most somatic cells.
meisosis is splitting into 4 cells in gametes which contain only half number of chromosomes
(this has a great evolutionary advantage allowing for genetic diversity in offspring)
(also, gives rise to the principle of segregation)

every somatic cell in the body contains the same DNA.
however, only a fraction of it is used in that cell's protein-synthesis, e.g. bone cells don't produce same as liver cells
the genes that 'switch' other DNA bases off are called regulatory genes   
regulatory genes may control the activity rates of protein-synthesis genes? many regulatory genes are common across all life

protein contains amino acids in unique orientations. 20 amino acids, 8 essential (from foods), 12 non-essential 
they function by binding to other molecules, 
enzyme is a protein that regulates a chemical reaction
hormone is a protein produced by specialised cells that are released into the bloodstream that affect another tissue

amino acids are structurally the same in all species.

regulatory DNA evolves quicker. humans have highest concentration of this than any other species studied

DNA is the basis of all life

mutation:
base substitution/point mutation (replacement of base in an amino acid)

one point a chromosome item will have a corresponding point on it's other item.
locus is a specific point on a gene.
genotype are the alleles at a specific locus
dominant is when only require one copy of allele in a genotype 
(So, how do recessive genes first come about without a carrier? Are they produced at birth, i.e. are new 'conditions' created all the time? What is the rarity?) 
A Mendelian trait is one which is determined only at a single locus, e.g. blood type

Polygenic is multiple loci, i.e. multiple genes, e.g hair colour, height
(Mendelian inheritence applies to each individual loci)
Most traits are this. 
In these cases, not just the the protein-encoded, but regulatory genes also

Mitochondrial DNA is inherited soley from the mother. So, any changes are mutations

Pleiotropy is where a single gene affects multiple characteristics 

phenotype are observed physical characteristics of gene 

Important: a dominant allele is not necessarily better, e.g. Marfan's  
Any allele on X chromosome for males will be present as no matching chromosome to block it

------------------------------------------------------------------------
if mapped the human genome in 2003, how does this affect genetic engineering/disease treatments? 
(Polygenic traits, we haven't determined all loci involved?)
is all the DNA in the nucleus exclusively packaged in a chromosome?
for chromosomes, each item from a pair is from either parent?
is the number of chromosomes specific to each species?
will the length of every person's chromosome pairs be the same?
genome project is only protein-coding DNA? the other is the ongoing ENCODE project?

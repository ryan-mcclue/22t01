Fixation of species questioned as travelled and discovered other fossils/animals.

non-western knowledge prior, however no formalisation of it so stays hidden

species is homo sapiens. 
genus is homo (things that have a lot in common). 
family is hominidae
order is primates
class is mammals
phylum is chordata (nerve cord and skeleton)
kingdom is animalia (multicellular that move about and ingest food)

genome is the entire genetic makeup of individual

natural selection due to competition (fitness is environment specific)
Evolution is not directional, e.g. peppered moths

Selective pressures from selective agents

rate of fertility important, e.g. bacteria (single-celled)

a cell is fundamental unit of life

eukaroytic cells:
  * nucleus --> DNA (23 pairs of chromosomes; 23rd are XY in males, XX in females), RNA (copy DNA information to ribosome)
  * cytoplasm --> mitochondria (ATP energy and mtDNA), ribosomes (protein synthesis)
    * somatic cells (diploid) --> body tissue
    * gametes (haploid) --> reproduction (egg cells and sperm cells forming zygote)

transcription happens at the nucleus (RNA) and translation occurs at the ribosome (producing amino acids)

DNA governs cellular activity.
sugars and phosphates form sides, complementary bases (A, G, T, C) form rungs. 
nucleotide is one individual side
three bases (triplet or codon) form a recipe for an amino acid.
a protein is formed from amino acids (20 amino acids)
so, DNA produces proteins and replicates

gene is a sequence of DNA bases. 
allele is variant of a gene (think about chromosome pairs)

mapping the human genome means that we have identified particular sections of a chromosome that are responsible for particular traits.
so, alterations within the bases of these sections (alleles) will produce variations of this trait

codominant is where two alleles dominint only together?

mitosis is splitting into 2 new cells in most somatic cells.
meisosis is splitting into 4 cells in gametes which contain only half number of chromosomes
(this has a great evolutionary advantage allowing for genetic diversity in offspring)
(also, gives rise to the principle of segregation)

every somatic cell in the body contains the same DNA.
however, only a fraction of it is used in that cell's protein-synthesis, e.g. bone cells don't produce same as liver cells
the genes that 'switch' other DNA bases off are called regulatory genes   
regulatory genes may control the activity rates of protein-synthesis genes? many regulatory genes are common across all life

protein contains amino acids in unique orientations. 20 amino acids, 8 essential (from foods), 12 non-essential 
they function by binding to other molecules, 
enzyme is a protein that regulates a chemical reaction
hormone is a protein produced by specialised cells that are released into the bloodstream that affect another tissue

amino acids are structurally the same in all species.

regulatory DNA evolves quicker. humans have highest concentration of this than any other species studied

DNA is the basis of all life

mutation: change in DNA established in a daughter cell (so from replication)
base substitution/point mutation (replacement of base in an amino acid)
chromosomal mutation (reordering, deletion, etc.)
mutation is the main source of variability

gene flow is movement of genes between populations
inbreeding increases the chances of an individual having homozygous recessive
genetic drift is random changes in gene frequency

punnet squares just give probabilty?

genetic bottleneck is rapid reduction in population size, then later increase

ways in which species choose mates influential in a trait that may seem impractical (antler size, peacock feathers, etc.)
also access to mates

one point a chromosome item will have a corresponding point on it's other item.
locus is a specific point on a gene.
genotype are the alleles at a specific locus
dominant is when only require one copy of allele in a genotype 
(So, how do recessive genes first come about without a carrier? Are they produced at birth, i.e. are new 'conditions' created all the time? What is the rarity?) 
A Mendelian trait is one which is determined only at a single locus, e.g. blood type

Polygenic is multiple loci, i.e. multiple genes, e.g hair colour, height
(Mendelian inheritence applies to each individual loci)
Most traits are this. 
In these cases, not just the the protein-encoded, but regulatory genes also
Also have environmental impacts as well

Mitochondrial DNA is inherited soley from the mother. So, any changes are mutations

Pleiotropy is where a single gene affects multiple characteristics 

phenotype are observed physical characteristics of gene 
(Environmental factors will affect phenotype as well)

Important: a dominant allele is not necessarily better, e.g. Marfan's  
Any allele on X chromosome for males will be present as no matching chromosome to block it

Evolution is change in allele frequency

Mutation must happen in gamete to inherit it

Reasons for gene flow include geography, cultural, founders effect (colonisation from small group)

Genetic bottle-neck is the loss of alleles due to some event, i.e. lack of genetic diversity 
Suspected happened to cheetahs as they have little genetic diversity

Evolution is two stages; variation and then natural selection

So, inheritence is determined by the particular alleles in the gamete chromosomes resulting from meisois

Similar traits from common ancestor is homology (interesting how skeleton of forelimbs (human arm) in mammals are very similar). 
From independent ancestors is homoplasy/analogy (assume these are not common in cladistics, otherwise no straightforward assumptions could be made!)

Hox regulatory gene very important in embryonic development

Interpreting Evolutionary Relationships:
Evolutionary systematics: will produce a phylogeny (lineage with time markers in mya; difficult to do as many more extinct species) 
A clade is a group sharing a common ancestor
Cladistics: determine homologies that distinguish members of a clade (so they will be derived from ancestral homologies)
will produce a cladogram (just ancestor-descendor relationships)
Utilise both to form a complete picture

As gene drift is random, simply isolating groups will lead to speciation

Biological species is reproductively isolated (so, not necessarily producing fertile offspring?):
Premating Isolating Mechanisms (habitat, temporal, behaviour, mechanical)
Postmating Isolating Mechanisms (egg fertilisation, sterile birth)

Another definition for species is evolutionary (require more as some species asexual), 
i.e. phenotypically distinct (useful in fossils)

Another definition for species is ecological species, 
i.e. physical and biological environment (e.g. terrestrial or arboreal, diet, behaviour)

Species:
Within fossils we have age and sexual dimorphism variations
Can only accurately determine by comparing with currently living closely-linked species
Genus: if can breed live offspring but not fertile, e.g. horse and donkey producing mule (this hybridisation is rare in nature, so go off adaptive zone; teeth good indicator here)

Fossil is any trace organism, e.g. insect in resin, bone, etc. 
In reality, very rare that circumstances allow for a terrestrial life-form to be fossilised

Verterbrae evolution in geological eras: Paleozoic (500 mya; Pangea), Mesozoic (Gondwanaland, Lauraisia, Dinosaurs), Cenozoic (current)
Mammals first appeared at end of Mesozoic and saw the change of reptiles to mammals as dominant terrestrial
Largely due to: larger brains, varied shaped teeth, endothermic
Placental mammals dominant

Processes of macro evolution:
Adaptive radiation: moving forth to an unused place 
Specialised and generalised traits

Pedigree is lineage

Cladogensis is when species branches into two or more.
Anagensis is one

Allopatric speciation results from geographic isolation (chimpanzees and bonobos Congo river)
Parapatric speciation have adjacent regions with large geographic area (baboons)

Evolution tempo: gradualism (slow and steady), punctuated equilibrium (bursts of change; more common)

Not everything is a direct adaptation, e.g. large antlers for mating, but to support it have large spinous process  

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium states that allele frequency only changes with evolutionary forces (self-evident?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
if mapped the human genome in 2003, how does this affect genetic engineering/disease treatments? 
(Polygenic traits, we haven't determined all loci involved?)
is all the DNA in the nucleus exclusively packaged in a chromosome?
for chromosomes, each item from a pair is from either parent?
is the number of chromosomes specific to each species?
will the length of every person's chromosome pairs be the same?
genome project is only protein-coding DNA? the other is the ongoing ENCODE project?
Why is interbreeding higher chance of genetic disorders?
What is random assortment or the randomness of DNA? If mapped genome, how can positions differ? If random, how can we say person will recieve Marfan's?

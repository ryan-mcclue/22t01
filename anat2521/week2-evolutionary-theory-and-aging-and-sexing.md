Fixation of species questioned as travelled and discovered other fossils/animals.

non-western knowledge prior, however no formalisation of it so stays hidden

species is homo sapiens. 
genus is homo (things that have a lot in common). 
family is hominidae
order is primates
class is mammals

genome is the entire genetic makeup of individual

natural selection due to competition (fitness is environment specific)
Evolution is not directional, e.g. peppered moths

Selective pressures from selective agents

rate of fertility important, e.g. bacteria (single-celled)

a cell is fundamental unit of life

eukaroytic cells:
  * nucleus --> DNA (23 pairs of chromosomes; 23rd are XY in males, YY in females), RNA (copy DNA information to ribosome)
  * cytoplasm --> mitochondria (energy and mtDNA), ribosomes (protein synthesis)
    * somatic cells --> body tissue
    * gametes --> reproduction (egg cells and sperm cells forming zygote)

DNA governs cellular activity.
sugars and phosphates form sides, complementary bases (A, G, T, C) form rungs. 
nucleotide is one individual side
three bases (triplet or codon) form a recipe for a protein. so, DNA produces proteins

gene is a sequence of DNA bases. only about 3% of DNA is copied in protein-synthesis

protein contains amino acids in unique orientations. 20 amino acids, 8 essential (from foods), 12 non-essential 
they function by binding to other molecules, 
enzyme is a protein that regulates a chemical reaction
hormone is a protein produced by specialised cells that are released into the bloodstream that affect another tissue

amino acids are structurally the same in all species.

if mapped the human genome in 2003, how does this affect genetic engineering/disease treatments?

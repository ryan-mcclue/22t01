# Week 10 - Bioarcheology and Forensic Anthropology
Bioarcheology is the study of human bones with contextual understanding of the archeological site they come from
Derived from processual archeology movement (merge with cultural studies)
So, understanding culture change, i.e. why something happened and thereby somebody's worldview:
* burial practices, sacrifice, mummification -> religious views
* culturally meaningful age/sex categories -> social identity
* diet, health, mobility
* urbanism, sedentism, domestication

Encompasses a number of methodologies:
* paleodemography (age and sex)
* paleopathology (trauma, body modification):
tuberculosis: degeneration of particular thoracic vertebrae
syphilis: skull lesions
congenital microcheplia: small brain
nutritional rickets: unusually flexible
degenerative osteoarthritis
(most diseases leave no traces on skeleton at all; especially acute as die quickly)

types of bone fractures: (ante,peri,postmortem)
  - transverse (line break)
  - oblique (line break at an angle)
  - comminuted (many little fracture)
  - greenstick (ends of bone not entirely displaced)
  - compression fracture
  - compound fracture (serious bone deviation)

trephination (removal of part of cranial for surgical purposes, e.g. relieve blood pressure)

* activity patterns
wolff's law: bone adapts to load under which it's placed (musculo-skeletal stress markers; larger deltoid tuberosity). opposite is true

* relationships/biological distance (dna)
nonmetric: shovel shaped incisor

* isotope analysis
diet: C13, N15 in protein component of bone and teeth, i.e. collagen
 - C4 photosynthetic pathway are tropical grasses, producing more C13 (new world, maize, sugarcane)
 - C3 are forest plants; rice, wheat, oats, legumes 
more N15 is more meat/seafood
mobility: Sr isotope in rock->soil->plants/water/fauna. So, can identify if someone was buried where they lived

hot humid environment not good for preservation of DNA

What is post-processual archeology?
cultures with 3rd gender?

# Week 1 - Introduction to Anthropology
All life evolved from the same origin, meaning we share a connection to all living things (as evidenced by DNA)

Anthropology is holistic and is the study of humans over time
Cultural (ethnicities), linguistic, archeology (artifacts - used by hominins), physical/biological (explore how and why humans have evolved genetically, physically and behaviourally; key word evolved)
Within physical anthropology (paleoanthropology, primatology, human biology, paleopathology, forensic anthropology, bioarcheology etc.)
Evolutionary theory (particularly natural selection) explains this change

Originally anthropologists concerned with visible differences (osteology), now more genetic, e.g. physical responses under stimuli like running at alitude, diet, etc. 

Paleoanthropology is particular to earlier hominins (so largely from fossil records)

Bioarchelogy can reveal burial practices, weapons used (from antemortem or perimortem trauma), religious offerings, body modifications, community worldview
Bones are useful: information on lifestyle, point of comparison, evidence of existence
Some serve to protect: skull (brain), rib cage (thoracic viscera)
Bones support movement and stability
Bone marrow produces blood cells, bones also store fats and minerals

Patella is a sesamoid bone (embedded in tendon) (although irregular some people can have other sesamoid bones, extra/missing rib, sutural bones) 

Bones will have hard section (compact bone) and soft section (spongy bone)

Bone cells: osteoblast produces, osteoclast absorbs. an osteocyte matures from an osteoblast

Blood vessels: vein towards heart, artery away from, capillary between vein and arteries

On femur when walking, compression on medial, tension on lateral side of shaft
Bone responds to forces by laying down new bone. so a lack of forces it will resorb and grow weaker
Slowest rates of remodelling in thickest areas of compact bone
Once adulthood, bones cannot grow longer but can still grow thicker and thinner (this can be seen comparing bone sizes between dominant and non-dominant arm in tennis players)

Most bone is formed from cartilage (endochondral ossification). So, the bone outline is cartilage and then gradually replaced with bone

Metaphysis is where the bone is lengthening. Epiphyses is end points. Diathysis is shaft

More interested in the 2/3 inorganic chemical composition of bone to determine diet and where they came from through isotope analysis?
Hydroxyapatite hardest thing in body. Higher concentration of it in tooth enamel than bone
Longer buried under ground, the less organic in bone. So, it becomes more and more brittle 
Nearly all of the body's calcium is stored in the bones

Tooth has top layer above gums called a crown (with enamel), then neck, and then long root with nerve endings
Peridontal ligament connects tooth root to tooth socket
Adults have 32 teeth, 4 quadrants, 8 in each (dental formula for humans and most primates is 2 incisors, 1 canine, 2 pre molars and 3 molars)

All living things absorb carbon, of use to us is the neutral radioactive carbon isotope

Hematoma is a large injury to blood vessel (as oppose to a bruise) resulting in a pooling of blood outside the blood vessel.
A callus will be formed as a bone fracture heals

Ethical issues in Australia with indigienous communities not wanting skeletal remains to be uncovered (Mungo man)

DNA contains genetic instructions. 
A gene is small section of DNA responsible for a particular trait.

Primates (monkeys) -> hominid (great apes) -> hominin (humans)

Species are reproductively isolated. 

To evolve, genes must change (different to adaptation). If resulting in speciation it is macroevolution.

Humans are a contemporary component of a vast continuum

Culture is behaviour passed down from nonbiological means. 
Humans are unique in that our behaviour is largely determined by culture. 
In fact, our culture has influenced our biological makeup leading to humans being products of biocultural evolution

Science is observation and experimentation, (observing and experimenting literal definition of empirical)
Called theory as it has been substantially verified through experimentation (allows for new insight from emerging technologies; not about defining absolute truths)

-----------------------------------
Examples of non-western explorers?
Seems 'traditional' societies are non-western e.g. mayan, african, etc. What about older white cultures?
Applied anthropology in resting positions (perhaps even child-rearing) 
What things are instinctive biologically in humans?
If humans obtain things culturally then they could be suboptimal. if we learn from primates that know things biologically, is their way of behaving more optimal than ours?
When stating 206 bone count, mentioned that this doesn't include sesamoid bones. what about the variability of the coccyx?
Easier to obtain mitochondrial dna than nuclear dna. Sometimes get lucky with nuclear dna, does this mean it's better?

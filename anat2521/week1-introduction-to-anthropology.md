# Week 1 - Introduction to Anthropology
All life evolved from the same origin, meaning we share a connection to all living things (as evidenced by DNA)

Anthropology is holistic and is the study of humans over time
Cultural (ethnicities), linguistic, archeology (artifacts - used by hominins), physical/biological (explore how and why humans have evolved genetically, physically and behaviourally; key word evolved)
Within physical anthropology (paleoanthropology, primatology, human biology, paleopathology, forensic anthropology, bioarcheology etc.)
Evolutionary theory (particularly natural selection) explains this change

Originally anthropologists concerned with visible differences (osteology), now more genetic, e.g. physical responses under stimuli like running at alitude, diet, etc. 

Paleoanthropology is particular to earlier hominins (so largely from fossil records)

Bioarchelogy can reveal burial practices, weapons used (from antemortem or perimortem trauma), religious offerings, body modifications, community worldview
Bones are useful: information on lifestyle, point of comparison, evidence of existence
Some serve to protect: skull (brain), rib cage (thoracic viscera)
Bones support movement and stability
Bone marrow produces blood cells, bones also store fats and minerals

Patella is a sesamoid bone (embedded in tendon) (although irregular some people can have other sesamoid bones, extra/missing rib, sutural bones) 

Bones will have hard section (compact bone) and soft section (spongy bone)

Bone cells: osteoblast produces, osteoclast absorbs. an osteocyte matures from an osteoblast

Blood vessels: vein towards heart, artery away from, capillary between vein and arteries

On femur when walking, compression on medial, tension on lateral side of shaft
Bone responds to forces by laying down new bone. so a lack of forces it will resorb and grow weaker

Ethical issues in Australia with indigienous communities not wanting skeletal remains to be uncovered (Mungo man)

DNA contains genetic instructions. 
A gene is small section of DNA responsible for a particular trait.

Primates (monkeys) -> hominid (great apes) -> hominin (humans)

Species are reproductively isolated. 

To evolve, genes must change (different to adaptation). If resulting in speciation it is macroevolution.

Humans are a contemporary component of a vast continuum

Culture is behaviour passed down from nonbiological means. 
Humans are unique in that our behaviour is largely determined by culture. 
In fact, our culture has influenced our biological makeup leading to humans being products of biocultural evolution


Science is observation and experimentation, (observing and experimenting literal definition of empirical)
Called theory as it has been substantially verified through experimentation (allows for new insight from emerging technologies; not about defining absolute truths)

-----------------------------------
Examples of non-western explorers?
Seems 'traditional' societies are non-western e.g. mayan, african, etc. What about older white cultures?
Applied anthropology in resting positions (perhaps even child-rearing) 
What things are instinctive biologically in humans?
If humans obtain things culturally then they could be suboptimal. if we learn from primates that know things biologically, is their way of behaving more optimal than ours?

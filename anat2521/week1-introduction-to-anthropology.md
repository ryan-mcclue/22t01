# Week 1 - Introduction to Anthropology
* Primates (monkeys) -> hominid (great apes) -> hominin (humans)
* Stone age (paleolithic, mesolithic, neolithic), bronze age, iron age
* DNA contains genetic instructions. 
* A gene is small section of DNA responsible for a particular trait.
* Species are reproductively isolated. 
* To evolve, genes must change (different to adaptation). If resulting in speciation it is macroevolution.
* Culture is behaviour passed down from nonbiological means. 
* Science is observation and experimentation, (observing and experimenting literal definition of empirical)
* Called theory as it has been substantially verified through experimentation (allows for new insight from emerging technologies; not about defining absolute truths)

All life evolved from the same origin, meaning we share a connection to all living things (as evidenced by DNA)
Evolutionary theory (particularly natural selection) explains this change

Anthropology is holistic and is the study of humans over time. 
Separated into:
1. Cultural (ethnicities)
2. Linguistic 
3. Archeology (artifacts - used by hominins) 
4. Physical/biological (explore how and why humans have evolved genetically, physically and behaviourally; key word evolved)
Within physical anthropology (paleoanthropology, primatology, human biology, paleopathology, forensic anthropology, bioarcheology etc.)

Originally anthropologists concerned with visible differences (osteology), now more genetic, e.g. physical responses under stimuli like running at alitude, diet, etc. 

Humans are unique in that our behaviour is largely determined by culture. 
In fact, our culture has influenced our biological makeup leading to humans being products of biocultural evolution

Bioarchelogy can reveal burial practices, weapons used (from antemortem or perimortem trauma), religious offerings, body modifications, community worldview

-----------------------------------
Examples of non-western explorers?

Seems 'traditional' societies are non-western e.g. mayan, african, etc. What about older white cultures?

If humans obtain things culturally then they could be suboptimal. 
if we learn from primates that know things biologically, is their way of behaving more optimal than ours?
Applied anthropology in resting positions (perhaps even child-rearing) 
What things are instinctive biologically in humans?
Example of biocultural evolution?
When stating 206 bone count, mentioned that this doesn't include sesamoid bones. what about the variability of the coccyx? (3 - 5 segments in coccyx?)
Easier to obtain mitochondrial dna than nuclear dna. Sometimes get lucky with nuclear dna, does this mean it's better? Can you only make a subset of inferences?

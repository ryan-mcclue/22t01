# Week 1 - Introduction to Anthropology
All life evolved from the same origin, meaning we share a connection to all living things (as evidenced by DNA)

Anthropology is holistic and is the study of humans over time
Cultural (ethnicities), linguistic, archeology (artifacts - used by hominins), physical/biological (explore how and why humans have evolved genetically, physically and behaviourally; key word evolved)
Within physical anthropology (paleoanthropology, primatology, human biology, paleopathology, forensic anthropology, bioarcheology etc.)
Evolutionary theory (particularly natural selection) explains this change

Originally anthropologists concerned with visible differences (osteology), now more genetic, e.g. physical responses under stimuli like running at alitude, diet, etc. 

Paleoanthropology is particular to earlier hominins (so largely from fossil records)

Ethical issues in Australia with indigienous communities not wanting skeletal remains to be uncovered (Mungo man)

DNA contains genetic instructions. 
A gene is small section of DNA responsible for a particular trait.

Primates (monkeys) -> hominid (great apes) -> hominin (humans)

Species are reproductively isolated. 

To evolve, genes must change (different to adaptation). If resulting in speciation it is macroevolution.

Humans are a contemporary component of a vast continuum

Culture is behaviour passed down from nonbiological means. 
Humans are unique in that our behaviour is largely determined by culture. 
In fact, our culture has influenced our biological makeup leading to humans being products of biocultural evolution


Science is observation and experimentation, (observing and experimenting literal definition of empirical)
Called theory as it has been substantially verified through experimentation (allows for new insight from emerging technologies; not about defining absolute truths)

-----------------------------------
Examples of non-western explorers?
Applied anthropology in resting positions (perhaps even child-rearing) 
What things are instinctive biologically in humans?
If humans obtain things culturally then they could be suboptimal. if we learn from primates that know things biologically, is their way of behaving more optimal than ours?

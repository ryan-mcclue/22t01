# Week 3 - Modern Human Variation and Osteometry
Humans first evolved from Africa, spread out and interbred with Neanderthals
Biocultural influences affect how we adapt to environmental challenges

Historically biological determinism (behaviour determined by genetics) and eugenics (racial out-breeding) with Europeans as superior

Homo sapiens are a polytypic species. 

Race is a somewhat dubious term often conflating genetics and culture.
Although it literally means phenotypic variation across geographical areas, there is no fixed-set guidelines to assess someone's race. 
Furthermore, with the advent of genetics (subfield as population genetics), even within groups the amount of genetic variation is large.
Also, although two people may differ in skin colour, the amount of other shared traits may be high, e.g. head shape, blood type etc.
In addition, certain phenotypes are influenced by the environment as well
So, race is not biological meaningful. Instead, use the term 'population'
However, there are some genes that indicate a person's geographical ancestry

Ethnicity is purely cultural

Focus on polymorphic traits, i.e. genes with two or more alleles (meaning different expression of same trait)

HLAs (white blood cells antigens) is the most polymorphic trait in humans (hundreds of alleles, multiple loci)

Greater genetic variety seen amongst Africans then any other geographic region in the world (giving more evidence to humans originating from Africa) 

Population is one that is capable of interbreeding, thus sharing a gene pool.
Various breed isolate, e.g. geography, cultural
Endogamy (breeding within group), exogamy (breeding out of group)
To determine in evolution occuring at a locus, compare allele frequency with that predicted by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (this also emphasises the fact that populations evolve, not individuals)

Nonrandom mating can affect evolution in modern human populations

Balanced polymorphism is where a population maintains two copies of an allele, e.g. sickle-cell anemia (positives and negatives)

Lactase persistence example of recent biocultural evolution (lactose is broken down when in cheese and yoghurt however)

From Africa (why we prefer hot and dry), 200-100kya. genetic drift as been major cause of humans polytypic nature
Humans have developed varied adaptations in response to particular environmental stresses to maintain homeostasis

An acclimatisation is adaption as a result of experiences in one's life. They can be temporary, e.g. tanning or permanent (developmental, i.e. experienced when body is developing?)

New world is Americas, Old world is Europe, Asia and Africa

Darker skin (higher levels of melanin) reduces UV radiation. As cancer is pronounced after reproducing, most likely due to inhibiting folate production in pregnant women.
Lighter skin (wearing animal skins) for vitamin D for bone development and fighting infections 

Sweat glands allow evaporation cooling (more effective with less body hair) which can be dangerous losing many vitamins and water.
Also have vasodilation (capillaries widen to allow more blood flow and thereby lose more heat to the environment)

Bergemann (more mass, colder), Allen (longer trunk, colder)

How can we be so polytypic, yet also be genetically similar compared to other primates?

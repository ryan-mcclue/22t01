# Week 3 - Modern Human Variation and Osteometry
Humans first evolved from Africa, spread out and interbred with Neanderthals
Biocultural influences affect how we adapt to environmental challenges

Historically biological determinism (behaviour determined by genetics) and eugenics (racial out-breeding) with Europeans as superior

Homo sapiens are a polytypic species (vast phenotypical differences amongst populations) 

Race is a somewhat dubious term often conflating genetics and culture.
Although it literally means phenotypic variation across geographical areas, there is no fixed-set guidelines to assess someone's race. 
Furthermore, with the advent of genetics (subfield as population genetics), even within groups the amount of genetic variation is large.
Also, although two people may differ in skin colour, the amount of other shared traits may be high, e.g. head shape, blood type etc.
So, majority of genetic differences seen between individuals
In addition, certain phenotypes are influenced by the environment as well
So, race is not biological meaningful (and can distract from real information) as the boundaries are arbitrary, e.g. how many races?
Instead, use the term 'population'
However, there are some genes that indicate a person's geographical ancestry

Took some time for people to accept all humans evolved from the same ancestor.
Similarly, typology was used to categorise subraces.
cline: gradual change in trait within a population, e.g. skin colour

Ethnicity is purely cultural

Focus on polymorphic traits, i.e. genes with two or more alleles occuring more than 1%
e.g. sickle-cell (balanced polymorphism, i.e. maintained heterozygous), lactase persistence, skin colour, etc.
(meaning different expression of same trait)
Can give indication of founder's effect
Haplotype is a combination of polymorphisms

Lemba people in Mozambique had oral history that they were Jewish, however due to their similar appearance to other Africans it was doubted.
Genetics showed they were. So, an example of genotype and phenotypes differences

HLAs (white blood cells antigens) is the most polymorphic trait in humans (hundreds of alleles, multiple loci)

Greater genetic variety seen amongst Africans then any other geographic region in the world (giving more evidence to humans originating from Africa) 

Population is one that is capable of interbreeding, thus sharing a gene pool.
Various breed isolate, e.g. geography, cultural
Endogamy (breeding within group), exogamy (breeding out of group)
To determine in evolution occuring at a locus, compare allele frequency with that predicted by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (this also emphasises the fact that populations evolve, not individuals)

Nonrandom mating can affect evolution in modern human populations

Balanced polymorphism is where a population maintains two copies of an allele, e.g. sickle-cell anemia (positives and negatives)

Lactase persistence example of recent biocultural evolution (lactose is broken down when in cheese and yoghurt however)

From Africa (why we prefer hot and dry), 200-100kya. genetic drift as been major cause of humans polytypic nature
Humans have developed varied adaptations in response to particular environmental stresses to maintain homeostasis

An acclimatisation is adaption as a result of experiences in one's life. They can be temporary, e.g. tanning or permanent (developmental, e.g. people grow up in mountaineous regions have larger hearts and lungs)

New world is Americas, Old world is Europe, Asia and Africa

Darker skin (higher levels of melanin) reduces UV radiation. As cancer is pronounced after reproducing, most likely due to inhibiting folate production in pregnant women.
Lighter skin (wearing animal skins) for vitamin D for bone development and fighting infections 

Sweat glands allow evaporation cooling (more effective with less body hair) which can be dangerous losing many vitamins and water.
Also have vasodilation (capillaries widen to allow more blood flow and thereby lose more heat to the environment)

plasticity: ability to respond physiologically to environment (no change in genotype)
adaptability is a positive form of plasticity
acclimatisation is a short-term adaptibility

adaptation is genetic change 

a phenotype change from plasticity would be growing up in high altitude (larger lungs, broader chest)

Bergemann (more mass, colder), Allen (longer trunk, colder)

responses to heat:
radiation: heat flow in EM
convection: to air molecules
conduction: physical contact
evaporation: water to vapour

To generate heat, increase metabolic rate (break down nutrients to generate energy, therefore heat)
Vasoconstriction reduces blood flow, thereby retaining heat (could also shiver)

At higher altitudes oxygen is less plentiful which can cause hypoxia

Up until 15kya. humans lived in hunter-gatherer groups, living a rather nomadic lifestyle. So, they never stayed neared refuse heaps to develop infections
The birth of agriculture changed this with zoonotic infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, influenza (swine or bird), malaria
For chimps, they carried SIV, however when given to humans (in Africa they sell butchered chimp) turned to HIV 
Increase in global warming can also increases virus vectors

Some Europeans resistent to smallpox seems to also affect the receptors involved with HIV

10kya. began living in settlements and burying dead together

Until recently, infectious diseases the main cause of human death

From skeleton, can infer:
Disease/Trauma: syphylus, hicking, fracture heals, embedded materials from weapons, etc.
Lifestyle: Have osteoarthritis (in particular areas indicating higher activity hear)
Diet: Permanently formed tooth enamel as a child reveals childhood diet. 
      Carbon and nitrogen concentrations in bone indicate if eating plants, terrestrial or marine animals
      Tooth decay

Even identical twins (single sperm one egg that splits) look different. non-identical (two sperm two eggs)
age, sex, ancestry and individual mutations all contribute

deme: population defined in terms of genetic composition, i.e. allele frequencies

species -> subspecies/race (can obviously still interbreed, so there is gene flow) -> population



----------------------------------------
How can we be so polytypic, yet also be genetically similar compared to other primates?

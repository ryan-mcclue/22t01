Some important sources of evidence are missing from your discussion, in particular the abundant evidence of healed and unhealed injuries in fossil hominins, some dating back several million years. 
Considering the importance of fossil hominins to this course, this evidence should be discussed. 

skewed towards the work of cultural anthropologists Ferguson and Kelly, both of whom have similar views on war


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
While you present convincing evidence that ‘the development of sedentary cultures increased the frequency of warlike interactions’ 
in Central and North West Europe at the start of the Neolithic, 
you do not present convincing evidence that this is true for other parts of the world.
EARLIER ON YOU MENTION ONLY TALKING ABOUT ONE REGION EUROPE. HOW CAN SATISFY BOTH OF THESE?

origins of warfare in Europe...

ESSENTIALLY TALK ABOUT EARLIER EVIDENCE OF VIOLENCE AND SPECIFIC THEORIES

cannibalism, healed injuries in neandanthals
populations in spain violent death of individual

When stated missing major publications, is this in reference to evidence or theories?

* provide specific numerical time period talking about. talk about specific geographic area.
* only discuss Europe
* discuss evidence of millions of years ago on early hominins (further back than stone age). 
so, talk more about hominins, rather than just homo sapiens?
* include more biological anthropological references and their varied main arguments.
* if mentioning an anthropologist, give their main argument (e.g. Keely warfare is common in small-scale societies and was likely common throughout human evolutionary history)

# Warfare an evolutionary perspective 
the propensity to be aggressive in order to out-perform
competing groups and gain fitness-related benefits is a trait that is likely
to be deeply rooted in human evolutionary history. 
(therefore, early hominins not warring)

The degree of organization among group members,
advance planning, division of labor, and use of tactic observed in
state-level warfare is rather unique not seen in early hominins 

Indeed, weapons or skeletal traumas could indicate
war or be due to other factors, including hunting of game or intra-
group violence.

warfare is a recent phenomenon in evolutionary terms and often
occurred at low frequency before state-level societies. Therefore
warfare has not exerted significant evolutionary pressure on
humans

current work suggests that humans have an
evolved propensity to act aggressively toward outgroup individuals,
under specific ecological conditions, irrespective to when warfare first
emerged and how frequently occurred during the course of human
evolution. 
violence has evolutionary basis, but has been accelerated by cultural influences


Bowles claims that groups of early humans
frequently encountered one another and aggressively competed over
valuable resources such as food or shelter
Alternatively, They argue that population density
of human groups has been estimated to be very low until around
15,000–8,000 years BP. Therefore, groups had few chances to meet
with one another, were not competing over limited resources and
were rarely waging war.


They claim that frequently used archeological indicators of lethal violence
are ambiguous, particularly those dating much earlier than around
15,000 years BP: signs of spears and of other weapons on skeletal
remains may be related to any kind of violence, such as family dis-
putes and mortuary cannibalism, or to post-mortem burial procedures
that have nothing to do with warfare. Similarly, archeological remains
of weapons may equally indicate warfare or hunting of large prey. The
only relatively unequivocal signs of warfare appear in the last
15,000–8,000 years, approximately around or immediately after the
agricultural revolution.

Some important sources of evidence are missing from your discussion, in particular the abundant evidence of healed and unhealed injuries in fossil hominins, some dating back several million years. 
Considering the importance of fossil hominins to this course, this evidence should be discussed. 

skewed towards the work of cultural anthropologists Ferguson and Kelly, both of whom have similar views on war


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
While you present convincing evidence that ‘the development of sedentary cultures increased the frequency of warlike interactions’ 
in Central and North West Europe at the start of the Neolithic, you do not present convincing evidence that this is true for other parts of the world.
EARLIER ON YOU MENTION ONLY TALKING ABOUT ONE REGION EUROPE. HOW CAN SATISFY BOTH OF THESE?

* provide specific numerical time period talking about. talk about specific geographic area.
* only discuss Europe
* discuss evidence of millions of years ago on early hominins (further back than stone age). so, talk more about hominins, rather than just homo sapiens?
* include more biological anthropological references and their varied main arguments.
* if mentioning an anthropologist, give their main argument (e.g. Keely warfare is common in small-scale societies and was likely common throughout human evolutionary history)


USE CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGISTS FOR THEORIES AND BIOLOGICAL FOR EVIDENCE?
# Lethal Interpersonal Violence in the Middle Pleistocene
# Bioarchaeological Contributions to the Study of Violence
Always been capable of violence

# Emergence of human warfare
theories
# Warfare an evolutionary perspective 
theories

First slides present theories. Then explain why proving a particular one (thesis)

# Week 3 - 
Primates very generalised:
* Limbs and Locomotion:
  - erect posture
  - flexible limbs for varied locomotion
  - prehensile hands and feet 
* Diet and Dentition:
  - omnivorous (good if one source runs out, however increased competition from other species) 
  - heterodonty (flat cusps in molars)
* Brain
  - stereoscopic vision
  - enhanced colour vision, reduced olfactory, bony protection of eyes
  - enhanced neocortex for sensory processing
* Maturation
  - enhanced fetal nourishment
  - reliance of derived learning with longer period of development
  - social groups with common presence of adults
  - diurnal

Evolution (genomic sequencing; humans have highest non-coding DNA) 
  - stereoscopic, vision and prenhensile resulting from aboreal living
  - brachiation (arm swinging from branch to branch)

We see in most nondivergent primates lemurs more cusped molars (insectivourous), eyes further apart, some claws, rhinarium, nocturnal etc.

new world (americas; outward facing nose) vs old world (apes?) monkeys?

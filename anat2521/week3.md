# Week 3 - Modern Human Variation and Osteometry
Humans first evolved from Africa, spread out and interbred with Neanderthals
Biocultural influences affect how we adapt to environmental challenges

Historically biological determinism (behaviour determined by genetics) and eugenics (racial out-breeding) with Europeans as superior

Homo sapiens are a polytypic species. 

Race is a somewhat dubious term often conflating genetics and culture.
Although it literally means phenotypic variation across geographical areas, there is no fixed-set guidelines to assess someone's race. 
Furthermore, with the advent of genetics, even within groups the amount of genetic variation is large.
Also, although two people may differ in skin colour, the amount of other shared traits may be high, e.g. head shape, blood type etc.
So, race is not biological meaningful. Instead, use the term 'population'

Ethnicity is purely cultural



----------------------------------------
How can we be so polytypic, yet also be genetically similar compared to other species?

These two philosophers first posed the question (prior to 60s, not much by anthropologists), that was then examined by anthropologists
Jacques Rousseau "noble savage"
Thomas Hobbes "war of all against all" (human societies always practice war, i.e. part of human existence. does not need a reason, nothing to stop it)

Blood Red Roses: The Archaeology of a Mass Grave from the Battle of Townton

10000 years ago (8000BC), northern iraq
people have weapons in skeletons
living in defendable sites
large arrow heads

although not indicators of war, it seems these things 'set the stage' for war:
war comes about because of people living sedentary lives, social hierarchy (people buried differently), long-distance trade
 

(Site 117, Sudan perhaps earlier)

War leaves behind skeletons, settlement patterns, weapons

So essentially, no war before 6000years. War between hunter-gatherers. 
This war intensified with European settlement 

It seems that war was not endemic in societies before 6000/7000 years ago?


Humans have an in-borne tendency to go to war:
Territorial Imperative (Robert Ardery)
African Gensis (Robert Ardery)
On Aggression (Konrad Lorenz)

The advent of european colonialism saw an intensification of war than just between hunter-gatherers
War in the Tribal Zone: Expanding States and Indigenous Warfare 


Napoelon Chagnon, Yanomamo: The Fierce People
Flawed in that it assumes modern day hunter-gatherers exhibit same behaviour as those before.
They are influenced by contemporary European things
Alternative: in a society like yanomamo, can't pay someone to be a warrior, so you reward them with women
Essentially, not enough game to satiate people staying in one place, so resort to violence (malthusian argument)
This makes war something 'rational', rather than something that wells up from our biology
The statistics compiled were only of people alive at the time (not their entire history)
(saying genghis khan had 1000 kids is irrelevent across entire history.)
(look in native american plains people, peace leaders had more kids. only in times of war, did warriors produce more offspring. this is in relation to being a warrior spreads your genes better)


War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage (keeley)
War in Human Civilisation: azar gat
very good for archeology

so, we see more war as time progresses.
the absence of war is not indicative of us not having the evidence, 
we do have skeletons and settlements. just no war 

although war capable 20kya. and 100kya and 
we would have no record if it you have to explain 
why did this go away when the archeological record began?

NOTE: contemporary hunter-gatherers have some sort of settlement, 
so to say that they are the same as 20kya. is wrong
also something like the nomadic horse-gatherers are hunter-gatherers, 
yet they use horses from the Spanish. so obviously not able to translate their actions to the past


The Human Potential for Peace: An Anthropological Challenge to Assumptions about War and Violence
very few violence in the most simple of societies
Warless Societies and the Origin of War

Steven Pinker: the history of violence
civilisation isn't the cause of violence, it's helping us overcome it.
counter: if you look at mesopatamian civisiliations, a lot of violence increase there...

The purely Roussean idea to get rid of violence is to go back to the Stone Age 


demonic males richard wrangham:
chimps go on raiding parties and stomp other chimps. evidence of violence genes dating back millions of years
counter: these are cases of disturbed chimps. there are whole other hosts of violence going on there, e.g. killing females in same group, children (not good for reproductive success); hyptohesising due to human impact
in general, like humans, they develop a continous range of behaviour

in general I think violence is learned, either culturally or because of the immediate environment, e.g. scarcity of resources

You are to evaluate the various theories that have been proposed and choose the one
which best fits the evidence.

Your paper must be argumentative and analytical.

Each paragraph presents only one idea


Go against what Roussea.

NOT: primitive warfare was very ritualistic, few casualties

humans have always be capable of war

----------------------------------------------------
War is not an innate part of human existence and has increased as a result of
1, 2, 3 (a mid-line between Roussea and Hobbes)
war comes about because of people living sedentary lives (settlements; agriculture),
social hierarchy (political structures to organise public opinion; self-interest to gain; people buried differently), 
long-distance trade (raiding precious materials, expanding trade network, protecting trade routes)

1st paragraph on the absence of violence in the archeological record

humans have come from a sporadically violent past

in egalitarian societies, man decides on war for himself

in these conditions, it's unlikely that a group would risk at the cost of more effort and greater hazard

material interests that 

evidence indicates a late emergence of violence/war

By analysing skeletal remains from various sites 

War leaves behind skeletons, settlement patterns, weapons

Stone age (paleolithic, (10000-8000)mesolithic, (-2300)neolithic), bronze age, iron age

Australian Aborigines have developed unique adaptations in response to environmental and cultural factors

'unique' in that they are not seen in Western Europeans 


Warlpiri people


co-sleeping practices? parent-infant


gender differences for sleep patterns?


The cooling adaptation of the Australian aborigines, 
which resembles the insulative cooling commonly found in mammals, 
differs from the metabolic compensation and greater peripheral heating developed in cold-acclimated white man.
Also the Aborigines do not shiver when they sleep. Some interesting vascular adaptions going on


sleep in particular places for 'Dreamtime' 


timekeeping associated with bedtimes and get-up times.

Do we have access to jstor? I can only read a subset of the pages provided.

These are what I have found regarding sleep:

Cold Hands and Warm Heart: It May Be in Your Genes: https://eosmith.com/cold-hands-warm-heart-may-genes/

From these some talking points:
  - Co-sleeping practices, i.e. they sleep together
  - Sleep time, i.e. they get up and go to bed at irregular times
  - Genetic mutation, i.e. adaption to cold and warm climates
  - Sleep positions, i.e. particular places for 'Dreamtime'

Not sure if this is suffient...

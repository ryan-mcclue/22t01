# Week 9 - Emergence of Modern Humans
Lower Paleolithic - Early stone age
Middle Paleolithic - prepared core (Levallois)
Upper Paleolithic - Late stone age (50,000; time of rapid pace of behavioural change; tools; symbology)
Starting of blade technology, microliths (arrow heads)

Modern humans -> Africa (200,000 first in Ethopia) 
-> Middle East (Skhul & Qafzeh, Israel; oldest deliberate burial Homo sapiens; 100,000 coincided with Neandanthals in different climates) 
-> Asia (40,000) -> Australia (50,000) -> Europe (40,000; Aurignacian culture) 
-> New World (via Siberia; Monte Verde; 30,000; 15,000 skeleton Clovis culture) -> 
Polynesia (3,000; From Phillipines and Taiwan; Lapita culture)

Required boats to travel across Wallace's line (Sahad and sahul)

First bit of modernity are from Blombos cave, South Africa

first evidence of modernity location and date: shell necklaces (blombos) and ochre, cave paintings, ochre in burial (afterlife), teeth modification (jade inlays)

Some people think older signs of modernity from Erectus making practically too big Acheuluan stone tools

1st signs of modernity: pinnacle point (160,000 eating seafood, mixing ochre rituals)

Modern behaviour, e.g. careful burying of dead, grave good rituals afterlife

Although possibly earlier, accepted first humans in Asia 40,000

Neandarthals soon disappear after first modern humans in Europe (40,000) and interbreeding

Seafood diet adapted in modern humans. Due to stable food source provided during glacial maxima

Art introduced as a means of establishing group identity and whether friend or foe 
(cave art petroglyphs, ornaments)

Inconclusive findings could be only tools found with no DNA or human remains

Easter Island one of the most isolated islands on Earth

Splitter view, out-of-africa also known as replacement model?
Late stone age encompasses upper paleolithic + mesolithic + neolithic?
Irregularities, Australia 50,000; Asia 40,000 but Asia first? (hard evidence expected to come)
Who used Levallois?
Name origin of homo sapien (knowledge)?

# Week 9 - Emergence of Modern Humans
Lower Paleolithic - Early stone age
Middle Paleolithic - prepared core (Levallois)
Upper Paleolithic - Late stone age (50,000; time of rapid pace of behavioural change; tools; symbology)
Starting of blade technology, microliths (arrow heads)

Modern humans -> Africa (first in Ethopia) -> Middle East (100,000 coincided with Neandanthals in different climates) 
-> Asia (40,000) -> Australia (50,000) -> Europe (40,000; Aurignacian culture) 
-> New World (via Siberia; 15,000; Clovis culture) -> Polynesia (3,000; Lapita culture)

Modern behaviour, e.g. careful burying of dead, grave good rituals afterlife

Although possibly earlier, accepted first humans in Asia 40,000

Neandarthals soon disappear after first modern humans in Europe (40,000) and interbreeding

Seafood diet adapted in modern humans. Due to stable food source provided during glacial maxima

Art introduced as a means of establishing group identity and whether friend or foe 
(cave art petroglyphs, ornaments)

Inconclusive findings could be only tools found with no DNA or human remains

Easter Island one of the most isolated islands on Earth

Splitter view, out-of-africa also known as replacement model?
Late stone age encompasses upper paleolithic + mesolithic + neolithic?
Irregularities, Australia 50,000; Asia 40,000 but Asia first?
Who used Levallois?
Name origin of homo sapien?

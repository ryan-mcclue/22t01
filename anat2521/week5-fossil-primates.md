# Week 5 - Fossil Primates
Ancestral skeleton traits such as pentadactly, unfused shoulder (clavicle), 
(many postcranial evidence of arboreal living)
divergent such as orthograde (more upright, not necessarily bipedal)

primates primarily evolved in Cenozoiac (65mya.)

last common ancestor (crown group) difficult to pinpoint as includes traits prior to a speciation event (as oppose to a stem group)

convergent evolution is similar trait evolved differently, e.g. mammalian leg, flipper, etc.

Taphonomy: study of occurences to fossils from death to discovery

Petrification (turning to rock), synonmous with fossilisation. 
Inorganic tissues replaced by absorbed minerals
(doesn't have to be skeletal, e.g. coprolite is fossilised faeces)

strata is layer of rock (stratigraphy). older strata is lower, younger cuts through

eon (precambrian, phanerozoic), era (paleo/meso/cenozoic), period (quaternary), 
epoch (pleistocene ice age, holocene)

relative dating techniques, e.g. say something is older than another however no number:
lithostratigraphy (rock layers), tephrostratigraphy (volcanic ash), 
biostratigraphy (faunal succession, i.e. animal we know age of appears somewhere else),
chemical analysis (fluorine), paleomagnetism (magnetic pole reversal)

chronometric dating. carbon-14 for organic materials as eat plants photosythesis (potassium-40 longer half life so useful for older, however requires potassium, e.g. volcano), 
tree rings, uranium, electron spin resonance
various methods applicable to materials present

----------------------------------
conditions for fossilisation have layer of water over fossil? is this good preserving?
(yarramundi body farm)

radiometric dating, so the granularity is half-life?

stone age and subsequent lithics are what?

crown group and stem group? why difficult to pinpoint LCA?

incipient dental comb? there are indications of future evolutions?

is euprimate anachronistic?

plattyrhines into new world via island hopping on natural mats of vegetation? 
accidental colonisation? aborigines on boats?

if life so plentiful and extended ontology of primates, don't understand how so diverse now?

# Week 5 - Fossil Primates
Ancestral skeleton traits such as pentadactly, unfused shoulder (clavicle), (many postcranial evidence of arboreal living)
divergent such as orthograde (more upright, not necessarily bipedal)

primates primarily evolved in Cenozoiac (65mya.)

last common ancestor (crown group) difficult to pinpoint as includes traits prior to a speciation event (as oppose to a stem group)

convergent evolution is similar trait evolved differently, e.g. mammalian leg, flipper, etc.

----------------------------------
crown group and stem group? why difficult to pinpoint LCA?

incipient dental comb? there are indications of future evolutions?

is euprimate anachronistic?

plattyrhines into new world via island hopping on natural mats of vegetation? accidental colonisation? aborigines on boats?

if life so plentiful and extended ontology of primates, don't understand how so diverse now?

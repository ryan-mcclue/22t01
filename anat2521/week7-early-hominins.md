# Week 7 - Early Hominins
Defining characteristic of hominins is bipedalism:
anterior foramen magnum, wider os coxae (curved ilium), s-shape spine, medially angled femur, 
longer femur, longer femural neck, thick hallux 

anatomical features of hominins:
decreased facial size. although brain fully size at age 7, not developed until 18
parabolic dental arcade, smaller incisors/canines, thicker enamel for nuts

first hominins in Great Rift Valley, East Africa (receding lakes)

shift to bipedalism resulting from cooling in climate, less forest more savannah  

late Miocene, first signs of hominisation

first potential hominins pre-australopithecus 7mya. than australopithecus 4mya.
branching from australopithecus are homo genus

diastema present with CP3 honing complex

2mya. for first homo fossil homo

(these are candidate early hominins, possess mosaic of traits, e.g. anterior foramen magnum but divergent big-toe)
(pre-australopithecus)
1. 7-6mya: sahelanthropus tchadensis (chad)
2. 6mya: orrorin tugenensis (kenya)
3. 4.5mya: ardipithecus (ethopia) --> long arms and phalanges indicates brachiation?

sectorial premolar sharpes/hones canine

(australopithecus the first established hominin genus)
4mya: small brain case, large jaw, small body size, long arms (probably slept in trees). 
broader/funnel shaped rib cage (indicating large gut to digest plant foods)
large sagittal crest for large temporalis muscles, i.e. chewing muscles
lack of feet arches
prognathic, fairly megadont
first stone tool maker (so probably when started to eat meat?)
1. 4mya: australopithecus anamensis (kenya, ethopia)
2. 3.9mya: australopithecus afarensis (Lucy, Laetoli footprints: ethopia)
3. australopithecus bahrelghazdi/deyiremedi/garhi

South African Australopithecus fossils found in breccia (broken rock clumped together)
So, fossils died in a sinkhole that is later exposed? So more complex geology than
East Africa Australopithecus fossils as have to isolate age from components of breccia 
3.5mya: australopithecus africanus: taung child



(alternative lineage, robust australopethicus developed larger jaws and molars)


human evolution (evolution radiation in Africa):
* energy efficiency: 
  bipedalism is more efficient than knuckle-walking
  better heat dissipation as being vertical blood flows from brain, less surface area to absorb radiation
* ecological:
  see over tall grass
* mating:
  charging to assert dominance
  males carry food to females
  (as females hide estrus, males stick around to ensure offspring)

-----------------------------------------
was last locomotion knuckle-walker?

if giving range, e.g. 7mya-6mya does this mean only relative dating possible?

early homo seems to have a longer femural neck?

if australopethicus first stone tool maker, how does this coincide with Stone Age dates?

things change, e.g. taphominic deformation from soil on bones

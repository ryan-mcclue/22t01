# Week 7 - Early Hominins

Defining characteristic of hominins is bipedalism:
anterior foramen magnum, wider os coxae (curved ilium), s-shape spine, medially angled femur, 
longer femur, thick hallux 

anatomical features of hominins:
decreased facial size. although brain fully size at age 7, not developed until 18
parabolic dental arcade, smaller incisors/canines, thicker enamel for nuts

first hominins in Great Rift Valley, East Africa

shift to bipedalism resulting from cooling in climate, less forest more savannah  

late Miocene, first signs of hominisation

first potential hominins pre-australopithecus 7mya. than australopithecus 5mya.
branching from australopithecus are homo genus

# Week 4 - (chapter 6 +) 
Primates very generalised:
* Limbs and Locomotion:
  - erect posture
  - flexible limbs for varied locomotion
  - prehensile hands and feet (opposable thumbs meaning they can move independently) 
* Diet and Dentition:
  - omnivorous (good if one source runs out, however increased competition from other species) 
  - heterodonty (flat cusps in molars)
* Brain
  - stereoscopic vision
  - enhanced colour vision, reduced olfactory, bony protection of eyes
  - enhanced neocortex for sensory processing
* Maturation
  - enhanced fetal nourishment
  - reliance of derived learning with longer period of development (longer lived)
  - social groups with common presence of adults
  - diurnal

Evolution (genomic sequencing; humans have highest non-coding DNA) 
  - stereoscopic, vision and prenhensile resulting from aboreal living
  - brachiation (arm swinging from branch to branch)

We see in most nondivergent primates lemurs more cusped molars (insectivourous), eyes further apart, some claws, rhinarium, nocturnal etc.

Monkeys (species demonstrate homoplasy):
new world (americas; outward facing nose) 
old world (sub-sahara africa and south-east asia)

oraguntans, gibbons (borneo, asia)
gorrillas, chimps, bonobos (central africa)
humans (bipedalism, most generalised digestive system, enhanced cognitive abilities (culture dependence, verbal/written speech) 

almost all nonhuman primates are critically endangered due to deforestation, hunting and trade

for most animals, behaviour is largely determined by evolutionary history of their genetics. e.g. cats play with mice as they evolved as predators, horses as prey 
behaviours have evolved through natural selection, i.e. behaviour is a phenotype
our evolution has been shaped by the ecological setting of our ancestors

primatologists concerned with how certain behaviour's determine reproductive fitness, e.g. primate males paternal, explaining some behaviour in males

as humans are very social, the social structure plays a key role

as in general, larger animals have less surface area relative to body weight they lose heat less quickly and therefore eat relatively less, e.g. 2 40kg people eat more than 1 80kg person.
similarly, lower body weight the higher the BMR (basal metabolic rate), so require higher caloric foods

food distribution is abundant and dense: large communities (leaves). scattered: small (insects, fruits)

shorter life span better for unpredictable environment as faster maturation rate

if prey, large groups better. this is the main reason why humans live in groups
so, it makes sense that our behaviour should reinforce the integrity of the group

primates have dominance hierarchies (decreases chance of violence)
as living in social setting, communication is an essential part (scents, gestures, grunts, autonomic, e.g. blushing)
violence is typically seen in response to lack of food or access to mates
many acts of appeasement/bonding are through physical contact (grooming being the most important)

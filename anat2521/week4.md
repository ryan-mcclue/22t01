# Week 4 - (chapter 6 +) 
Primates very generalised:
* Limbs and Locomotion:
  - erect posture
  - flexible limbs for varied locomotion
  - prehensile hands and feet (opposable thumbs meaning they can move independently) 
* Diet and Dentition:
  - omnivorous (good if one source runs out, however increased competition from other species) 
  - heterodonty (flat cusps in molars)
* Brain
  - stereoscopic vision
  - enhanced colour vision, reduced olfactory, bony protection of eyes
  - enhanced neocortex for sensory processing
* Maturation
  - enhanced fetal nourishment
  - reliance of derived learning with longer period of development (longer lived)
  - social groups with common presence of adults
  - diurnal

Evolution (genomic sequencing; humans have highest non-coding DNA) 
  - stereoscopic, vision and prenhensile resulting from aboreal living
  - brachiation (arm swinging from branch to branch)

We see in most nondivergent primates lemurs more cusped molars (insectivourous), eyes further apart, some claws, rhinarium, nocturnal etc.

Monkeys (species demonstrate homoplasy):
new world (americas; outward facing nose) 
old world (sub-sahara africa and south-east asia)

oraguntans, gibbons (borneo, asia)
gorrillas, chimps, bonobos (central africa)
humans (bipedalism, most generalised digestive system, enhanced cognitive abilities (culture dependence, verbal/written speech) 

almost all nonhuman primates are critically endangered due to deforestation, hunting and trade

for most animals, behaviour is largely determined by evolutionary history of their genetics. e.g. cats play with mice as they evolved as predators, horses as prey 
behaviours have evolved through natural selection, i.e. behaviour is a phenotype
our evolution has been shaped by the ecological setting of our ancestors

primatologists concerned with how certain behaviour's determine reproductive fitness, e.g. primate males paternal, explaining some behaviour in males

as humans are very social, the social structure plays a key role

as in general, larger animals have less surface area relative to body weight they lose heat less quickly and therefore eat relatively less, e.g. 2 40kg people eat more than 1 80kg person.
similarly, lower body weight the higher the BMR (basal metabolic rate), so require higher caloric foods

food distribution is abundant and dense: large communities (leaves). scattered: small (insects, fruits)

shorter life span better for unpredictable environment as faster maturation rate

if prey, large groups better. this is the main reason why humans live in groups
so, it makes sense that our behaviour should reinforce the integrity of the group

primates have dominance hierarchies (decreases chance of violence)
as living in social setting, communication is an essential part (scents, gestures, grunts, autonomic, e.g. blushing)
violence is typically seen in response to lack of food or access to mates
many acts of appeasement/bonding are through physical contact (grooming being the most important)

competition for mates is high for males, so want to reproduce as much as possible to pass on their genes, i.e. have a higher reproductive fitness
(infanticidal is an example of this, as killing children allows the mother to care your children)

most mammals are k-selected, i.e. produce a small number of offspring, but invest large amounts of effort into it (as oppose to r-selected like fish)

the lack of sexual dimorphism is a good indicator of long-term monogamous bonds

modern humans have a very high encephilisation (brain larger than what is predicted based on our body-to-brain ratio)
the neocortex being the most recently developed part of the brain responsible for cognitive thinking comprises 80% of our brain.
our brains continue to grow outside the womb (unlike other primates), requiring significant energy (so must be evolutionary beneficial)

human language is distinct in that it's symbolic, i.e. refer to immaterial things, things in the past etc.

language is left hemisphere. left hemisphere controls motion of right body. left hemisphere is dominant in most people, so most people are right-handed

the cultural behaviour of great apes makes them interesting to understand early hominins?
they lived in areas similar to that of our ancestors, so we probably had similar behaviour?

principle benefits of aggression are protection and territorial expansion to get more food and mates

many primates perform altruistic acts (most notably humans with empathy)

--------------------------
often look at chimps because of their closeness to us to understand early hominin life. does this mean that from our common ancestor, chimps have had less in-between species?
how do you know if that trait is unique to chimps or shared?
so, if right-hemisphere is dominant in someone, they will be left-handeded? what about ambi-dextrous?
is nasal index narrow to broad?

# Week 8 - The Genus Homo 
Pleistocene cyclic glaciation (glacial maxima when cold). 
As more water frozen on land (ice sheets), sea level dropped
So, periods of drying and cooling. 
This promoted the reduction of forest lands, leading to savannah.
So, climate change greatly influenced Homo.
Holocene 10,000 years ago. Not sure if just in an interglacial period starting 10,000 years ago.

A more derived trait means more human (as oppose to primitive)

Homo, 3rd molar smaller than 2nd molar?
Rounded brain case, reduced prognathic, smaller teeth, 
larger body (possibly due to increased meat diet through tool use)

* 2.4-1.4mya: Homo habilis (Tanzania)
still had larger anterior teeth and U-shaped dental arcade compared to later Homo
saggital keel/torus rounded and no muscle attachments like crest 
big brow ridge
* 2.1-1.78mya: Homo rudolfensis (Kenya)
not conclusive if habilis and rudolfensis different species
* 335,000-236,000: Homo naledi (South Africa)
long curved thumbs, strong forearms

paleolithic; older (2.5mya - 250,000), middle (50,000), upper (12,000)

acheulean hand-axes

Homo confrontational (mostly small animals) and passive scavenging (hominin cut marks on top of carnivore cut marks on bone. have to fight off other scavengers)




----------------------
how could neandethals and sapiens interbreed if different species?

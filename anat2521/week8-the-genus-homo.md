# Week 8 - The Genus Homo 
Pleistocene cyclic glaciation (glacial maxima when cold). 
As more water frozen on land (ice sheets), sea levels dropped 
(up to 120m:  Asia/North America; Australia/PNG <-Wallace's Line-> Mainland/South Asia connected;)
So, periods of drying and cooling. 
This promoted the reduction of forest lands, leading to savannah.
So, climate change greatly influenced Homo.
Larger home range, increase in diet quality, larger body size
Holocene 10,000 years ago. Not sure if just in an interglacial period starting 10,000 years ago.

A more derived trait means more human (as oppose to primitive)

Homo, 3rd molar smaller than 2nd molar?
Rounded brain case, reduced prognathic, smaller teeth, 
larger body (possibly due to increased meat diet through tool use)

* 2.4-1.4mya: Homo habilis (Tanzania)
Although established, still bits and pieces before 2mya in terms of conclusive first-homo (bosei, garhi)
Oldowan tools (pre-Oldowan is australopithecines)
still had larger anterior teeth and U-shaped dental arcade compared to later Homo
saggital keel/torus rounded and no muscle attachments like crest 
big brow ridge
most likely scavengers
* 2.1-1.78mya: Homo rudolfensis (Kenya)
not conclusive if habilis and rudolfensis different species
* 335,000-236,000: Homo naledi (South Africa)
long curved thumbs, strong forearms

paleolithic; older (2.5mya - 250,000), middle (50,000), upper (12,000)

acheulean hand-axes, tear-drop shape

Homo confrontational (mostly small animals) and passive scavenging (hominin cut marks on top of carnivore cut marks on bone. have to fight off other scavengers)

torus is thickening of bone

* 1.8-0.05mya: Homo erectus (Nariokotome boy; first species leaving Africa: Georgia -> Indonesia (java) -> China (peking man))
(ruminations of true homo erectus in Europe, Spain. Spain is place of oldest European hominin)
Thick boned, saggital keel/torus, no chin.
Elongated skull (occipital and angular torus)
Pentagonal posterior shape (widest point lower than on modern humans)
Shovel shaped incisor (some people in Asia/Americas have this) for stronger enamel using teeth as tools
Longer lower limbs, reduced upper limbs
Short, broad pelvis. Symphsis narrow for bipedalism, therefore young born small heads and grow

Shovel shaped canines

Acheulean tool use (symmetry and intended design shows brain development)
However, some Erectus populations still used Oldowan (Asia)

Fur loss, more sweat glands, (lighter skin underneath fur like chimps. so evolved darker skin)
Much more carnivorous diet (smaller large intestine, larger small intestine, i.e. small gut as meat easier to digest), migratory, lowly dense populations
Leisure time as meat highly nutritous
Reason for venturing, to capture more animals and obtain more meat
* Possible difference to erectus 1.8-1.0mya: Homo ergaster (in Asia)
* (-18,000) Homo Floresiensis (Flores, Indonesia). Hobbit. 
Insular dwarfism
Descended from Erectus


Modern humans:
chin, canine fossa, rounded/bulbous cranium, large mastoid, small teeth

Archaic homo sapiens (not separate/defined genus between sapien and erectus? 
So, perhaps regional?):
Homo heildedlbergensis (europe) -> possible ancestor to neandanthals
Homo rhodensis (africa)

(-40,000) Denisovan (russia, tibet)
(230,000 - 28,000): Neanderthal (belgium, middle east)
mid-facial prognathic due to swept back cheeks, no chin
mousterian


----------------------
how could neandethals and sapiens interbreed if different species?

All life evolved from the same origin, meaning we share a connection to all living things (as evidenced by DNA)

Explore how and why humans have evolved genetically, physically and behaviourally. Key word evolved for anthropology, i.e. over time
Evolutionary theory (particular natural selection) explains this change

DNA contains genetic instructions. 
A gene is small section of DNA responsible for a particular trait.

Primates (monkeys) -> hominid (great apes) -> hominin (humans)

Species are reproductively isolated. 

To evolve, genes must change (different to adaptation). If resulting in speciation it is macroevolution.

Humans are a contemporary component of a vast continuum

Culture is behaviour passed down from nonbiological means. 
Humans are unique in that our behaviour is largely determined by culture. 
In fact, our culture has influenced our biological makeup leading to humans being products of biocultural evolution
